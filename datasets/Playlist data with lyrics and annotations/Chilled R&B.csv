Lying here with me?
Giving the best of me

A million reasons why
We could've said goodbye
But my heart can't deny
How it feels when you're by my side
If we get any closer now
We won't have to dream
The feelings that we shared
Already reign supreme, oh

If we lost our minds
Blew up like dynamite
Wouldn't that be nice?
Wouldn't that be nice?
If we gave up the life
Threw it all aside
Wouldn't that be nice?
Wouldn't that be nice?

[Verse 1: Gallant]
Poured another shot of Bulleit after a fight
Then you took one look into my tortured eyes and you realized
That this was never what you came for
Something down the middle without the burn
It was volatile, money made it worse
Covered up the hurt
Plus you never could believe that I loved you
For exactly who you were
Before you got caught in the game
Before you changed your address and your name, girl
I never could have built this universe
Without you at the front of the gate
But you won't look at me the same

[Chorus: Gallant]
So if we lost our minds
Blew up like dynamite
Wouldn't that be nice?
Wouldn't that be nice?
If we gave up the life
And threw it all aside
Wouldn't that be nice?
Wouldn't that be nice?

[Verse 2: Brandy, Gallant & Both]
Oh-oh, the lit fuse is creeping up
Is time moving slow enough?
Caught in our collision course (Oh-oh)
Exactly what we signed up for (Exactly what we signed up for)
With Neptune in retrograde
Got used to the shine (Of rose-colored haze)
Now we're restless in the cosmic bed we made
And I can't read your mind, woah
Fortified, we were
Somewhere we crossed the line (Crossed the line)
And this guilty conscious stays in overdrive
Tryna rectify
Rearrange and redefine
Before we capsize

[Chorus: Gallant, Brandy & Both]
If we lost our minds (Lost our minds)
Blew up like dynamite (Dynamite)
Wouldn't that be nice? (Oh)
Wouldn't that be nice?
If I gave up the life
Threw it all aside (Oh, baby)
Wouldn't that be nice?
Wouldn't that be nice? (Oh)
Woah, woah

If I lost my mind
Lit the dynamite
Never compromised
Would it make it right?
If we gave up our life

Signing bad contracts, I almost had lost it
Quiet my conscience, I hate I ignored him, oh-oh, oh
I got out that shit May 31st
Call up my Amaal, spent my last on her
Everything changed for me on June 1st
All Mine just dropped and I'm on the first

[Chorus]
My parents told me I was special
Told 'em I'm gonna be successful
All of these nights that I've been workin'
Gon' pay off, just look at my journey
Just four years ago I was servin', servin' (Servin', servin')
Now it's Easter Sunday, at the service, service
And I'm just grateful for all of my journey (Journey)

Send me on a trip to the moon
Take me high as hell while we're still in this room
Send me on a place in the sun
I'll go where you wish so we can start where it's new

I'll give you one slow kiss
Something in me's missing you
Tell me, what will you do?
Say you'll give me one more kiss
Something's telling me that you've been missing me too

I've been working hard ever since
Got rid of everything, I used to pret–µnd
Only you can be with me
Without you I will ceas–µ until we can be

So let love show the way
Give me the gray
Take my space
You will be all I need and more
So let your river flow and fountain pour

I'll give you one slow kiss
Something in me's missing you
Tell me, what will you do?
Say you'll give me one more kiss

Before all's lost I'm glad I found you
Rather than waste our light, tell me we're cool
I've had enough of fighting

I'll give you one slow kiss
Something in me's missing you
Tell me, what will you do?
Say you'll give me one more kiss

I just wanna vibe tonight and be around your essence
Sip a little wine tonight and get up out yo exes
I can't even charge you 'cause you deserve all these blessings
I don't want tomorrow, want right now 'cause it's the present
I got a gift for you, can I take a flick with you?

Need a half a minute, private suite tonight
With a private villa, let's go public to the world
Girl that's gon' kill 'em
I'm talking hand holding, glass toasting
Red wine, lambs chops
Got 'em slow roasting, ooh
I gotta new chef in my crib
That's not the only thing I got prepared
Take your shoes off, my rug Persian
We should cool off, hot tub's working
Wait 'til that wine gets open

Girl, I'm done fakin' love
Got my mind made up and I can't do this no more
But somehow, you got me so unsure
It goes two ways in love
Can't be the one chasin' us
All my money and time, I can't spend it no more
Can't be myself if I can't be yours

Look, never been the one to play the fool
Always been the one to keep it cool
I'm a player, got me breakin' rules
Ever since I f–µll in love with you
Keep it one hundred lik–µ the proof
Drinkin' all night, please excuse
Anythin' I'm 'bout to say to you
I don't really got nothin' to lose
Swangin' and ridin', I pull up and slide in you
Say it's just me but I feel like you're lyin'
Your phone's goin' crazy, you switch it to silent
I only do that when there's somethin' I'm hidin'

You've been out here, tryna run your game
I've been thinkin' I should do the same
But I could never put you through the pain
I don't wanna have to turn the page
See which way the story 'bout to play
We might have to try another day
We gon' have to try another way
Leanin' and drivin', I'll be there in five
And you in a position before I arrive
And I don't need no guidance, you wet like Poseidon
I wish it could be like this every time
