All of them failed in the end, but Ariana is thankful because her current lover, Dalton Gomez, shows affection like no other.\n\nIn spite of the fact that it’s hazy how they met, Ariana has been sharing an expanding number of cuddly photographs with her sweetheart Dalton. They have been together since January of 2020, and Ariana seems to be happy in the relationship making songs showing how much she loves him.\n\nSeveral of Ariana’s songs showed that none of her exes understood how much she loved and cared for them and that they never truly loved her. An example lies in the unreleased song titled “Nobody Does It Better”:\n\nBut I warned you she wasn’t who she claimed to be, And no one could love you like me.\n\nAgain, in a heartbreaking song “Forever Boy”, Ariana asks her exes do not truly love her. Another lyrical message of no one from her past showing affection.\n\nCan’t nobody love you like I do. Baby, I could do better. Boy, if you knew better. You would do better. Baby, if you love me like I love you.\n\nThe rest of the album (Positions) seems to be filled with songs showing that she has no intention of stopping her relationship with Dalton.\n\nhttps://images.app.goo.gl/k4T1vxpgAg1TiwXk6\n\n     A photo of Ariana and Dalton together.']]), ('I’ma love you even though I’m scared (Oh, scared)', [['In this line, Ariana is alluding to her previous relationships and how they didn’t work out. She is scared to love again for fear they may not last, and doesn’t want to give her heart to something temporary.\n\nIn 2013, she stated to Seventeen:\n\nLove is a really scary thing\n\nIn December 2018, she also stated to Billboard that she falls hard easily when saying:\n\nThis is how I meet people — I can’t just, like, meet someone at a bar. I live fast and full-out, and I make mistakes, and I learn from them and I’m grateful no matter what happens.\n\nIn the past, Ariana has been in many relationships and has additionally broken off engagement with Pete Devidson.']]), ('Learnin’ to be grateful for myself (Oh, oh, oh)', [[""This could be an allusion to a thread of Tweets Ariana Grande soon deleted after posting, in which she spoke of not being deserving of the love she received from fans.\n\n\n\nThis could also be an allusion to Ariana Grande’s PTSD, which was a result of the Manchester bombing in 2017. She also said in an interview with Vogue on how she didn’t deserve to speak of the traumatic event:\n\nI know those families and my fans, and everyone there experienced a tremendous amount of it [PTSD] as well. Time is the biggest thing. I feel like I shouldn’t even be talking about my own experience–like I shouldn’t even say anything. I don’t think I’ll ever know how to talk about it and not cry.\n\nPTSD often renders people ungrateful for themselves, thus causing Ariana Grande to have to learn to be thankful for herself once more.\n\nAriana is currently learning to be grateful for herself and not her ex and with this line she is paralleling the one in the chorus of the song “thank u, next”:\n\nI’m so fuckin' grateful for my ex""]]), ('I wanna love me (Ooh)\n The way that you love me (Ooh)\n Ooh, for all of my pretty and all of my ugly too\n I’d love to see me from your point of view', [['Ariana wishes to see her partner’s perspective of her, which would help her in accepting her flaws and build up self-love.

They are told that if an anxiety-provoking situation arises, they should do their best to remove themselves from it.\n\nAriana has been very open about her anxiety in interviews and songs. For instance, her song “breathin” references her experience with social anxiety and the feeling of not being able to breathe or move.\n\nIn this song particularly, Ariana is likely saying that she is working to calm her anxieties and is still in the process of healing, so she needs to “get [better] at not leaving” or taking flight.

So what you been doin'?
I've been lovin' my life, wakin' up on my own
Are you doing the same thing?
You can say if you like, but I don't need to know
And I, I, I've been wondering why we've been wasting all this time
So what you been doin'?
I thought that I saw you, I guess I was wrong
Are you doin' the same thing?
Convincing yourself you're better alone
And I, I could tell you how you never left my mind
But then you tell me that you miss me, and I'm like

The Coldplay song is thematically similar to Troye’s verse, as it discusses the pain involved in love.\n\nHowever, Lorde’s song doesn’t seem to be related to this one, although the term “buzzcut season” relates to Lorde and her childhood friends getting haircuts at the beginning of summer.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/troyesivan/status/1087417293095632896\n\nTroye’s 2018 single “My My My!,” contained a similar line:\n\nSpark up, buzz cut\nI got my tongue between your teeth']])]",0.9948,0.9948,0.5539,Aroused

Started out in the Wednesday rain
Lights from the restaurant touched your face
Hall & Oates songs echoed of the marble floors
But I was feeling insecure
I swear I'd never made mistakes
But then again I never felt this way
You have so much less to lose when you're alone
If you think of me when your home

That I'll get hurt if keep falling like that

By specifying that it should take place on a Sunday, a day traditionally associated with holiness, Grande emphasizes the wholesome and pure nature of their relationship.\n\nShe then follows it up by saying she and her partner have sex the following day. Specifically, she uses the phrase “make love”, showing that while the relationship is very much a sexual one, it also has emotional depth with long-term implications as well.\n\nGrande even released merchandise with these lines on them:']]), ('This some shit that I usually don’t do (Yeah)', [['In this line, Ariana Grande might be alluding to her past relationships and how such failures in love would make her wary to continue in such again. With botched dating attempts with partners such as Nathan Sykes, dating for only four months before separating, and the late Mac Miller, with whom she dated for two years. Perhaps her most heartbreaking blow was when she announced she’d broken off her engagement with comedian and actor Pete Davidson after an only five month long relationship.\n\nThese are only a few out of many relationships Ariana Grande has/rumored to have been a part of, though they make an example of how she might be cautious before choosing another partner in the future.\n\nThis can also be an allusion to the sexual references in the song. Usually, a woman takes a submissive stance during sex, but in previous lyrics, Ariana Grande has hinted at wishing to be more dominant in bed.']]), ('I’m just hopin’ I don’t repeat history', [['Soon after the release of the song, fans noticed that she splits the word “repeat” to make it sound as she’s saying “Re-Pete”, alluding to her past relationship with Pete Davidson.\n\nShe is trying not to repeat what happened in that relationship or in her other relationships with her current boyfriend, Dalton Gomez.\n\nAriana is someone who puts her boyfriends as a priority to improve the relationship with her partner. She is trying to change her history with her boyfriend, doing new things in this one.\n\nAriana dedicated a whole song to her ex-fiancé but the couple eventually split apart a few months after that.']]), ('I’m in the Olympics, way I’m jumpin’ through hoops', [['There are a number of events at the Olympic Games which involve hoops, including rhythmic gymnastics and basketball, though this line is probably referencing the former:\n\n\n\nAriana could also referencing the classic Olympics logo, which consists of five interlocking multicolor rings (the “hoops” in question).\n\n\n\nThis line continues the theme of Ariana’s commitment to making the relationship work. She’s willing to go to great lengths (“jump through hoops”) to make sure that their love stays intact.']]), ('Heaven sent you to me', [['Ariana gave us a sneak peek at the opening lyric to “Positions” just hours before its release via her Twitter account.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/ArianaGrande/status/1319426962595717120\n\nThis isn’t the first time Ari has used the concept of a lover being “sent from above” to express her gratitude. Take her 2018 song, “pete davidson” where she sang:\n\nUniverse must have my back, fell from the sky into my lap\n\nThe fact that this lyric echoes one written during a past relationship of hers (one that ended on a particularly bitter note at that) imbues this lyric with a different feeling. This time around, she’s not jumping into the relationship with the same blind optimism: she’s made enough mistakes in past relationships to realize she can’t afford to do it again.\n\nSome fans believe that “heaven” can be interpreted as a reference to Grande’s ex-boyfriend, Mac Miller. She has written about him in previous songs, and fans speculate that she feels that Miller sent her the person she is now in a relationship with to ease her pain.']]), ('Know my love infinite, nothin’ I wouldn’t do', [['Ariana teased this lyric on her Twitter account on September 14th, over a month before releasing “positions.”\n\nhttps://twitter.com/ArianaGrande/status/1305585212059910144']]), ('Yeah\n Ah, yeah\n Ah (Ah), yeah', [['Like the intro and some parts of the song, the outro was teased on 15 September 2020, with the caption “brb,” (short for be right back) prior to the release of the new single.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/ArianaGrande/status/1305680296260501504?s=20\n\nThe outro vocals were again featured in a teaser video to the song, which is released a day before the drop of “positions.”']]), ('Switchin’ them positions for you\n Cookin’ in the kitchen and I’m in the bedroom', [[""The chorus gives the term “positions” a double meaning. In one instance, it refers to Ariana changing her role in the relationship (going from domestic work to making love). On the other hand, it refers to changing sex positions while in the act.\n\nIn the song’s music video, where Ari can be seen playing the role of the President of the United States, this line takes on a whole different meaning: she’s moving from Cabinet meetings to signing executive orders to doing press conferences to handing out the Medal of Freedom. Her job as the President means she has to know how to “switch positions” at the drop of a hat, and not only that, but she’s also in a “position” that’s typically held by a man, so a woman in office means it’s being “switched”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring the first chorus, we can also see that Ariana takes “cookin' in the kitchen” very seriously.""]])]",0.9935,0.9935,0.6949,Aroused

The underestimated power of this woman’s love suggests a bittersweet edge to this story of love.  The way the writer eludes to how he “finally worked it out” leaves the outcome ambiguous and infers that only with time will this folly be fully realized.

When your love doesn’t line up.” This can be seen in this verse as it shows rejection from a former lover. Ashton adds: “Lie to me lyrically is totally inspired by heartbreak but attempting to move on.” We can sense this positive message in the last lines of this verse, the narrator tells himself that his past lover is in a happier place, probably realising that their split is for the best.']]), ('Remember thinking that I got this right', [['The narrator thought that they had finally found love, but as shown in the chorus they know that their partner doesn’t truly care for them.\n\nA transition can be seen in the whole album.

I think you could take it in the most literal sense possible, like I need you on my chest, chest to chest, even though I guess hearts are on the opposite sides.  On the flip side, I think the way I see heart to heart is like, “Why can’t we just chop this up? Why can’t we just talk about this? Why can’t we just open our hearts to each other and figure out what went wrong?” You know what I’m saying?  ‘Cause a lot of relationships kind of end in a dismal spot. With my last one, there was kind of confusion, like distance kind of separated us, but there was never a true closure period or a true sign off message, like “Okay, this is why it happened.” Luckily, me and G are very stark in the contrast. I’m like completely over my last person type, so you can tell based off of talking to him that he’s still got the linger period. He’s still in that phase. Granted, his relationship was much deeper and more involved than mine. Mine was more of a summer fling type. A lot more innocent. At the end of the day, I personally don’t see myself doing that anymore. I’m just like a total free bird at this point, I feel like. But yeah, I think there’s still things that’ll bring up this person in my head. I try never to creep on their pages or anything. That definitely helps. I think when you’re constantly like, “Oh, do they have a new man? Do I need to like flex with a new girl or something?” Then like try to combat them, it’s like, no. You start playing these weird mental games. I just had to distance myself.']]), ('She’s sleeping on your side, what can I do?', [['It’s like you don’t even want this girl to be sleeping on this side. You’ll wake up and be like, “Man, I wish this was just my person. Straight up.” There’s not much you can do in that sense, but you think in the time being that this is gonna help. Whatever you’re doing. I think everybody notices in time that the only thing that can heal it is time. None of these coping mechanisms will actually end up helping you get out of this spot that you’re in mentally.']]), ('I’m looking at her face but I’m seeing you', [['Jack J: So I feel like this line is really kind of like, from certain girls that I’ve talked to, like a girl’s worst nightmare, almost. Like knowing that that they might be rebound or something, or knowing that they might be a void filler. I definitely, post my last relationship, I definitely kind of when into a phase where I was trying to fill the void by either going out or maybe I’ll just have a one night stand over here. It just means nothing at the end of the day. You think, personally, that it’s gonna help you cope, but it always ends up backfiring. ‘Cause, like I said, I’m looking at her face, but I’m seeing you. Even having that significant other around, having that touch, having that person around, that makes you instantly think of that person that you just lost, you know what I’m saying?']]), ('Even if I tell myself I can\n I know that I’ll break (I’ll break) before I can bend, yeah', [['Even in my head, if I’m like, “Nah, I’ll be good.

Whatever.” Even if I tell myself I’m gonna get through this, I know that I’ll break before I can bend. Before I can adapt to the situation, the circumstances that I’m in, and really actually make it work for me, I know I’m gonna break. Because I’m gonna throw it on full fledge. I’m gonna drink as much as I can, I’m gonna go have as much fun as I can, and do all the stuff that I know I’ll regret. That’s pretty much the break.

I’m totally not the kind of guy to go get a bouquet of flowers and a teddy bear, but I specifically did that one time when my girlfriend was pissed at me. I showed up. I was like, “Hey, I’m so sorry. Let’s just go to dinner and talk about it.” She was thrilled. I was like, “Damn. That’s really all I gotta do? Okay.” But then after that, it’s like, “Wait, but you already got me the teddy and roses. I want this.” And that’s fine, too. Whatever. I feel like those are material things, and that’s probably why the relationship is over. 'Cause that’s not how a relationship should work. Maybe sometimes. I don’t know. Time is probably the most valuable thing you can give in any relationship, not even just a sexual relationship, in a friendship. You gotta give someone else time.

I think no one compares to her for me, because I can’t be with someone for as long as I was with her, if that makes sense. I can spend hours and hours, and days and days just really not even saying anything, but just feeling her presence. We would do that all the time. We’d just do everything together. That’s something that I have found that is really hard to do with someone else. For someone else, she might not be all that.

I like to share my feelings with people, and sometimes your boys aren’t the best people to share your feelings with. It’s nice to have that person, like a girl. For me, that’s how it is.

I always wanna make sure I’m living a healthy life, and I always wanna make sure I’m being the best me that I can be. Sometimes, someone who seems like they’re everything to you and are perfect for you ends up maybe damaging certain other parts of your life. I know that it’s hard to see it when you’re in it, but an unhealthy relationship is actually very common, I feel like. Especially at the age of 20 and 22, or whatever. When I do find the one, I hope it’s in a couple years down the road, maybe five or six years down the road, ‘cause I have a lot of work to do personally to make sure I’m ready when I do find that person.

One Direction was extremely overworked, having released five albums and gone on five world tours, and more, in just 5 years.

In this bridge, Zayn says that he need to be able to breathe, after being choked with work for so long. He wanted to be able to really live.\n\nThe second line talks about how he had been waiting for a way out, wanting to be shown the light outside of the troubles he had been facing as a part of the band. The third line refers to how Zayn had been holding his pain inside and not talked to anyone about it. A few of the members of One Direction have mentioned being upset that they hadn’t known how much Zayn didn’t like being in the band that he had to leave.\n\nThe last line could be a reference to Zayn’s last One Direction concert on March 18, 2015 in Hong Kong, where he noticeably cried during the show. Although it had not been announced that Zayn would be leaving the band until a week later, Zayn somehow knew that it was his last concert.

However, it was later revealed that Zayn had not shown up, even though he had agreed to. Obviously, we do not know the full circumstances of why Zayn had not gone, but it seems that Louis was upset about that.

Throughout the entire time they were together, it seemed like nothing could take away what they had.']]), ('I’d rather be anywhere, anywhere but here\n I’d rather be anywhere, anywhere but here\n I close my eyes and see a crowd of a thousand tears', [['In these lines, Zayn alludes to his performance anxieties and how uncomfortable he feels on stage. Over the past few years, Zayn has been open about his struggles with anxiety. After he released his mega-successful album “Mind of Mine” in 2016, he pulled out of the Summertime Ball Festival at Wembley Stadium which would have been his first live UK solo stage performance, and then pulled out of an event in Dubai, citing his anxiety for both of these occurrences.\n\nIn an apology posted to his Instagram, Zayn detailed his performance anxiety:\n\nTo all those people who have been waiting to see me perform at the Capital Summertime Ball today. I flew into the UK last night to appear in my home country in front of my family, friends and, most importantly, my UK fans.\nUnfortunately, anxiety, which has haunted me throughout the last few months around live performances has got the better of me… with the magnitude of the event, I have suffered the worst anxiety of my career.\nI cannot apologize enough, but I want to be honest with everyone who has patiently waited to see me. I promise I will do my best to make this up to everybody I’ve let down today.\nI know those who suffer from anxiety will understand, and I hope those who don’t can empathize with my situation.\n\nIn a November 2018 interview with Vogue, Zayn reminisced on his band days and their abrupt shoot to stardom:\n\nI think back to the performances towards the end, when we were in stadiums, I wasn’t really ever able to enjoy the experience. The machine had gone too fast. We went from theaters to arenas, to stadiums, there was never any sort of bridge between. Just boom, boom, boom,” he said. “I guess that kind of progression to any mind – but especially when you’re 17, 18, it kind of effects you a little bit. People take it different ways – especially when there are five different personalities. The relationships had broken apart.']]), ('I pray to God I didn’t waste all my good years\n All my good years\n All my good years', [['ZAYN’s departure from One Direction in 2015 sparked up a debate about whether he actually “wanted to be a normal 22-year-old”, as the official statement claims, or whether his position in the group wasn’t maintainable anymore.\n\nIn his first interview after leaving the band, he made the shocking revelation that he never actually wanted to be in the band\n\n“I always wanted to go, from the first year really. I never really wanted to be in the band. I just gave it a go because it was there at the time.”\n\nIn a November 2018 interview with Vogue, Zayn noted that ‘he’s finally in a place where he can look back on his One Direction years without a mixture of fury and panic’. He went onto to ponder what life could have been if he’d never joined the band\n\nYet he still wonders what life would have been like had his mother not shaken him awake at 4am for that X Factor audition. “It definitely wasn’t anything like this. I had kind of an idea I wanted to be a teacher,” he says, and doesn’t sound like he hates the idea. Instead he smiles, the eyes that broke a million hearts narrowing in thought as he sits quietly in the New York rain, imagining what might have been.\n\nMoreover, in the chorus ZAYN is wondering if he has made a mistake by joining One Direction in the first place. ZAYN joined One Direction when he was only 17 years old and left the band at 22 years old. He contemplates how his life could’ve turned out if he didn’t join One Direction, which even leaves him wondering if he didn’t waste “all his good years.”']]), ('Too much drugs and alcohol\n What the hell were we fighting for?\n ’Cause now the whole damn world will know\n That we’re too numb and just too dumb to change the story\n Neither one, one of us wants to say we’re sorry', [['In verse two, Zayn subtly touches on relationship with former bandmate Louis Tomlinson. They were notably close throughout their band years, and in May 2014, the Daily Mail leaked a 5 minute video of the two smoking weed and joking around on the way to a concert in Peru.\n\nIn May 2015, about 2 months after Zayn left One Direction, the two had a falling out on Twitter. Zayn eventually tweeted:\n\n@Louis_Tomlinson remember when you had a life and stopped making bitchy comments about mine ?\n\nLater that month, Louis addressed the feud in One Direction’s appearance on James Corden’s Late Late Show:\n\n“There’s been a bit of back and forth. ""I’ve never been good at bitin\' me tongue. Maybe I get it from me mum. It’s just one of those things. Twitter’s great for connecting with fans, but also if you feel like saying something you probably shouldn’t. [We’ve talked it out and] It’s all good with him.”\n\nIn an interview with Capital FM, Zayn clarified that the two were still nowhere near friends, but showed respect to him regardless:\n\n“Obviously I wish him the best of luck. His kid is cute as fuck so obviously, I favorited it. We’re not talking on friend terms obviously, so that’s as far as I can go, by favoriting his picture. We’ll see if I get an invite [to visit the baby].”\n\nWhen Louis\' mother passed after a long battle with Leukemia in December 2016, and Zayn tweeted his condolences. In an August 2017 interview, Louis said they’d squashed the beef after his mother’s passing. He noted that one of his mother’s last wishes was for them to reconcile their friendship.']])]",0.9954,0.9954,0.1779,Aroused

It’s the same the whole way through and it’s you get songs like quite art. Even like “Harlem” by Bill Withers, obviously, God rest his soul. It’s one of my favorite songs of all time and he does it, it always starts with that familiar like, “Summer night in Harlem, winter night in Harlem, that was really hot.” Jump me and stuff in it and then the change comes after this.
