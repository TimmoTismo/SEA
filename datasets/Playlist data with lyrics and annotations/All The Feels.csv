Perhaps Drake’s girlfriend thinks she’s too good for Drake.\n\nDrake’s girl has been listening to her friends, and it seems where they were once excited by their relationship, they’re now unsure.\n\nIt’s possible his alleged DM'ing of porn star Mia Khalifa has something to do with this, and with his dating history plastered all over the internet, this girl might just be gassed up from rumor reports.""]]), ('I tried with you\n There’s more to life than sleeping in and getting high with you\n I had to let go of us to show myself what I could do', [['A throwback to the message on “Karaoke” off Drake’s first record, where he lamented the death of a relationship due to his desire to forge a rap career.\n\nThings have been so crazy and hectic\nI shoulda gotten back by now\nBut you know how much I wanted to make it\nIt’s probably better anyhow\nSo if you gotta go\nIf there’s anything I should know\nIf the spotlight makes you nervous\nIf you’re looking for a purpose\n\nOn this occasion it appears Drake tried significantly harder, but being stuck sleeping and getting high with her has diminished his work capacity.

It's hard to settle down when you need me
Need me

[Verse 2]
You drove to town
You made it down
Didn't think I'd see you here
You're staring hard, staring hard
But I'm past you steering clear
Cause you know how
You know how to take me back a year
How to take me back a year
[Pre Chorus]
I can't say I'm surprised anymore
I mean I felt it all, I felt it all
When you come crashing down
Who's supposed to save you now

[Chorus]
When you're out here wylin
Phone buzzing on silent
And you don't give a fuck what your man think
Riding out the wave till the sun hit
Cause you out here wylin
Phone buzzing on silent
Living out a life that you can't keep
It's hard to settle down when you need me
Cause you out here wylin
Phone buzzing on silent
And you don't give a fuck what your man think
Riding out the wave till the sun hit
Cause you out here wylin
Phone buzzing on silent
Living out a life that you can't keep
It's hard to settle down when you need me
Need me

And now that it's over, I'll never be sober
I couldn't believe, but now I'm so high
And now that it's over, I'll never be sober
I couldn't believe, but now I'm so high
But now I'm so high
But now I'm so high
But now I'm so high

Girl, what's your problem?
'Cause I know it's hard sometimes, baby just give it some time
Oh honey now girl, we can solve them
If you just give me some time I can open up your mind
If you let it shine, you can free your mind
'Cause I know

And now that it's over, I'll never be sober
I couldn't believe, but now I'm so high
And now that it's over, I'll never be sober
I couldn't believe, but now I'm so high
But now I'm so high
But now I'm so high
But now I'm so high
[Verse 2]
Girl, if it's done right
Well you know it's got to be, something wonderful to me
Oh honey now girl, give it one night
If you just give it a chance, loving you is not my plan
Cause I know one day you'll see
All the things that we can be
No, no, no...

[Bridge / Beat Switch]
And now that it's over, I'll never be sober

This could have been made around the time the girl Donald wanted to marry broke up with him:\n\nWe went to Australia and I was just super depressed. I mean, I tried to kill myself.

Now that it’s “over”, he acknowledges how he’ll always keep coming back for more. Furthermore, he’s foreshadowing a relapse into her addicting love.\n\nThis could also be referring to him being constantly high and never coming down from that high (and being sober). That could be a more likely idea because as Glover has said himself, he’s stopped drinking for the most part.\n\nIt’s possible that the beginning line of “And now that it’s over” is referring to him waking up at the end of the STN MTN mixtape, and is continuing on from that onto the Kauai EP.']]), ('If you just give me some time I can open up your mind', [['Gambino is asking this girl for the most precious thing we have as humans: time.

Frank can’t “show [his] face” nor be around those who talk down when he is brought up in conversation. Usually, spitting on someone is interpreted as a sign of disrespect. Thus, this action is met with the cold touch of ignoring those that do so.\n\nIronically, “spit for me, yeah” is heard in a sexual tone as if it is perfect contradiction with the previous aggressive bar towards the notion of “spit”.']]), ('I’m the only one out here on the night loops\n I’m the only one out here on the night loops', [['Frank may be reminiscing about driving or “looping” around the long, winding highways of California at night. Although their quite busy during the day, he’s the only car out on the roads when the sun goes down. He previously expressed his love for highways on “Solo”:\n\nNow stay away from highways\nMy eyes like them red lights\nRight now I prefer yellow\nRedbone, so mellow\n\nThis may also reference Frank’s worth ethic when producing “Provider,” a boom-bap, contemplative drum loop that Frank probably produced late at night when no one is in the studio. Alternatively, this line connects to how people struggle and working nights for their family. Frank states that he has been in that situation himself, in the sense how he had been working in the studio through the night, working on and shaping his songs.']]), ('Watch friends, go pro through fisheye lens, drownin’ off clear\n I just saw JAWS, divin’ under influence', [['A GoPro is a video camera with a fisheye lens that is often used to film action sports. Its founder originally created it to take videos while surfing in the ocean. Jaws may refer to the 1975 Steven Spielberg-directed thriller about a man-eating shark or pro skater Aaron Homoki, whose nickname is “Jaws""—many of Frank’s closest friends are skaters.\n\nThe ocean water is clear, but “clear” also refers to clear liquor like vodka and gin—“drowning” is slang for being drunk, meaning “diving under the influence” is an allusion to drunk driving.\n\nFrank has seen his friends\' strong career beginnings, but he’s also seen them suffer from the trappings of success.']]), ('Chest pass, see mist off rotation (Swish, swisha)', [['In basketball, a chest pass is one that’s thrown straight from the torso with two hands. A good chest pass has a lot of spin on it, which Frank romanticizes by suggesting you might see “mist” coming off of it because of how fast it’s spinning.\n\nFrank may be suggesting he is sharing smoke with his partner from by standing chest-to-chest with them and exhaling directly into his their mouth. This is also called a shotgun kiss.\n\nThe ad-lib plays off both interpretations, since “swish"" is the sound a basketball makes when it goes through the net and “swisha” is slang for Swisher Sweets cigars.']]), ('New man comin’ up ahead on his own two', [['“On his own two” is an abbreviation of the idiom “stand on your own two feet, which means accomplishing your goals on your own.\n\nIf this “new man” is a love interest, he may be Memo Guzman, since Frank mentioned him at the beginning of the verse.']]), ('Memo finna start acting out if I don’t see him soon\n Yeah my best friend ain’t backing out, it’s still on sight, fool', [['Memo Guzman was spotted with Frank at the Mayweather vs. McGregor fight on August 26, 2017, the night before “Provider” was released. Frank’s relationship with Memo was previously unknown, but it appears that they are close friends, possibly more. This would add an extra meaning to his line from 2016’s “Futura Free”:\n\nYou must ain’t get the memo\nI don’t cut bitches no more\n\n\n\nMemo tweeted “Provider” lyrics on July 7, far before the single’s release.']]), ('Sleepin’ on my belly in a loop like a serpent\n Talking Heads ripplin’ on the surface', [['“Loop like a serpent” is an allusion to the Ouroboros, an Ancient Egyptian symbol of a snake eating its own tail that represents cyclicality and the infinite cycle of life and death.\n\nTalking Heads were an influential NYC-based indie band in the 1970s and ‘80s that helped spearhead the new wave movement. They’re also credited with revolutionizing looping and have been described as “human samplers.” Frank listed their track “Road to Nowhere” as one of his favorite songs in his Boys Don’t Cry ‘zine.\n\nWhen dealing with this lover, Frank goes through a cycle that ends with him listening to music as he falls asleep alone because his lover will not grow up.\n\n\n\nIn a Tumblr post, Frank said he only sleeps on his stomach or his side to avoid lucid dreaming.\n\nHe also references the sleep issue(sleep paralysis)  in the song “Alabama”\n\nSleeping on my back, my body would wake up after me”']]), ('Been feelin’ like the Lord just out of reach for me (for me)\n How I feel lettin’ man speak\n How I feel lettin’ man speak for me (for me)', [['Frank was raised Christian and seems to believe in God, but his romantic relationships with men complicate his faith. He explored the relationship between his faith and sexual identity on “Bad Religion” from 2012’s channel ORANGE. Frank left the pronoun in the line “I can never make him love me” vague enough that it works as a lamentation both that he could never win over a male lover and that, by trying to win his affections, he lost God’s love.\n\nFrank has expressed fear that acts of God will tear him and a lover apart, so it seems as though he has consistently felt that God is judging him for his lifestyle. But he has also depicted God more beneficently on songs like “Biking” where he assures himself, “God gave you what you could handle”.\n\nHere, “man” also alludes to mankind as a whole, because “man” is often used in the Bible to reference all of humanity. Frank may be suggesting that God’s commandments aren’t all-encompassing because everyone’s different.']]), ('You had you some birthdays, could you prove it?\n Show me the wisdom in your movement\n Show me some wisdom in your movement', [['Frank has not seen this lover in a few years, and Frank is challenging them to show him what they have learned, sexually. As we grow older and experience new lovers, our own sexual prowess improves as we adopt techniques from our sexual escapades.\n\nThe chorus makes clear that Frank still has feelings for this person despite their recklessness. But unless the lover shows they have matured in their time away from Frank, Frank fears that their relationship will end for the same reason that it did when they were both younger.']]), ('Holyfield, keep your ears split for me', [['Evander Holyfield is a boxer whose ear was infamously bitten off by Mike Tyson during their June 28, 1997 Heavyweight Championship match.

In the previous line he blames her for their current status, suggesting her behavior has created mistrust and hostility.\n\nWhen people argue they often do or say things to hurt one another, and “taking it too far” means the girl has gone beyond the bounds of arguing, causing irreparable damage to the relationship. Her friends are hesitant to tell her the truth about her actions, likely because they want to remain supportive.\n\nDrake recalls that since the start of the relationship she has been very self-centered, instead of reciprocating his love.

Drugs and violence into your left

Shadow shows no emotion so what's even the fuss?

""Look blud, I'm sorry, 'cause I know you got my back
He was running, I couldn't think, I had to get out of that""
Not long ago you were miming to the ""Shook Ones""
Now this really is part two 'cause you're the shook one
Hands you the tool as you question your friendship

Something has gone wrong, someone needs help and someone needs safety.\n\nWe have no idea if Jorja is involved, this is not important, she would rather the lights be strobe lights from a party or a rave, or possibly a festival – Christmas or Bonfire Night.\n\nFlashing blue lights on the street look beautiful. All UK road signs are fitted with retroreflective coating which is especially reactive to blue LED lights. When the blues are on in a particularly built up area, the level of illumination and reflection is awesome, in the truest sense of the word.\n\n\n\nShe wants to turn those blue lights into strobe lights as strobe lights are known in raving party or clubs, as for the blue lights, she also mentioned them in the second line that they are flashing, so this means the blue lights are the police and they wanted something good to happen instead of something bad because the police are known to show up whenever there’s something wrong. Fairies produces magical tiny lights when they fly and this is portrayed in the second and forth line which says that maybe something magical or in other words, good or positive, to replace the visit of the police, as the police are known for many innocent murder cases and many people are trying very hard to avoid these polices as they see their lights flashing the streets.']]), ('You’re sitting on the 4 back home', [['The 4 Bus goes from Walsall to West Bromwich.']])]",0.9824,0.9824,0.3286,Sad

When Karlie Kloss debuted for the Good Girl Perfume Commercial Campaign in 2017, she contributed to a new image of the Good Girl; A Hard-Working Feminine Woman Chasing Her Dreams with a mystery that is as unique as the tones of the Perfume. Our perception of the Good Girl is challenged by this singers persistent focus of attention on the inner qualities of this girl; She has inherent inner qualities that make her appealing to the singer. There is no mention of her sexuality or promiscuity. Nothing to do with how she presents herself. Instead, the soulful song has an emphasis on what a Good Girl she is and how that makes the singer feel about her; he falls deeply and passionately for her even though he is not with her.']]), ('In another time, in another place\n You would be mine', [['We believe that being in the same Time and Space Continuum is enough to forge a connection between two human beings. The starting verse of this song leads us to believe that this is perhaps the only thing keeping the singer away from his love interest. The Melancholic tone of his voice gives away his sadness. He might not believe this about himself. When we think of being with someone, we think of physical presence, we think of time and place. The singer has led us to believe he has neither of these, yet hopes, albeit unconvincingly that his lover could meet him differently if he had Time and Space.']]), ('On a brighter day, under a different sky\n Maybe we’d fly', [['On “You Can’t Save Me”, SiR sings about about meeting the perfect person at the wrong time. In this line, he says “on a brighter day, under a different sky, maybe we’d fly”, which describes the feeling that if the circumstances were different, and SiR was in a better place to accept the love, maybe they’d be a successful match.\n\nIf you pay close attention, you’ll notice that only a few tracks later is a song titled “New Sky”, which is about meeting a girl that he feels like he’s met before and has a connection with already. Possibly the same girl from this track.']]), ('Yes, I was in the wrong place at the wrong time with the right one', [['A major recurrent theme throughout the album includes SiR noting how he finds himself caught in the wrong time for certain situations and relationships.\n\nIn an interview with DJBooth, SiR explains""\n\n…I think we have less control over destiny than we wanna give credit sometimes…Timing is everything, but nothing happens when I want it to.

Deep down in my heart, I hope you're doing alright
But from time to time I often think of why you aren't mine

I got you leaking like a brake pipe

I said for years, I heard I took Hollow's name and I steal bars
And y'all had the nerve to book this shit on Hallows Lane? At the Steel Yard?
But ain't no need to wonder what kinda angles I'm about to take
'Cause out the gate, we gon' get this multiple choice out the way
Should I A: Give him gun bars, 'cause that's what my people love?
Or B: Prove I'm more of a Don than he ever was?
Or C: Bring up that time we was brawlin' in the club?
Yo, London, y'all know the answer, right?
(ALL OF THE ABOVE!)
I got a bullet, with somebody's government on it
It's time to send it
They don't need to ask the name on this Hollow, 'cause Nigel been it (Bennett)
What'chu gon' do? Pull out paperwork? Have some kinda gimmick?
'Til I blow your brains all over that L.O.M. brand
That should help you mind ya business
This was booked for Houston, 'til his people told him that he shouldn't do it
Tried to warn him to not appear (a peer) pressure like a good influence
Never seen a duck before?

(*John John pulls out a handheld mirror*)

Here's one, lookin' stupid
But the last time we seen Hollow in the mirror is when I put him through it!
But let me guess, to beat you, I'ma need a bunch of random shit
Like Xanny scripts from Anna Smith
Evander's fist and Santa's list? Wrong
How 'bout smoke from a Sig' (cig')? Call it my ""cancer stick""
Slanted clips that goes both ways: that's a banana split
That hammer lift, I'll put the grip on his cheek like when granny pinch
When you go, ya son go, your girl, make it a family trip
I was gon' get him separate ways, but I don't like seein' families split
So I got him all in one shot, that's a family pic (pick)
But why we never see you wit' a chick?
I gotta watch this guy
I mean, not even the mother of ya child? What'chu got to hide?
I think you bi, and live a pair of lies (paralyze) so you can't stand it
No wonder you named yourself ""Hollow"", 'cause you the trans parent (transparent)
{Hollow pulls out a sign that says ""He Stole That Line""}

But what's ya son name again? Lennon?
Look, Lennon, I know ya mom trippin'
'Cause Daddy don't wanna make her an honest woman so you gettin' raised off of my whippings
Next time he go to discipline you, you tell him he wastin' his time, Lennon
Until Mommy get the biggest rock band ever
Every beat'll (Beatle) be coming from John, Lennon!
But please don't say the John if you ain't sayin' it twice!
And if you don't add ""Da Don"", you ain't sayin' it right!
Want some advice? Change ya name 'cause you not no Don, bro
But he can say it twice like me, so I can hollow Hollow
Now hollow Hollow or Hollow hollow
Talkin' headshot, leg shot, how low Hollow?
No, red dot, dead shot, I'll high-low Hollow
Laughin', under my breath ""hee-hee-ha-llow"" Hollow
But y'all said I got my name from him? Fuck no, never
You had no influence on my career whatsoever
I don't drink syrup or profit off of taxes for cheap shirts
And post importantly, I would never lose a fight if I swing first
Now I'mma prove he ain't nothin' like how he appear to y'all
And I got the perfect way to do this
Hollow, let's play ""Swear To God""
Swear to God, you ain't ask me to not bring up the fight and made me sign an NDA
Don't worry
{John John brings out the supposed NDA contract}

This the Non Disclosure Agreement, but guess what?
Nigga fuck you, I'ma talk about it anyway
Aye, I know y'all heard the rumors, I'm not sayin' that they all the truth
But if I didn't beat yo' ass, when you swung on me first, why did they have to pull me off of you?
But that's old Hollow
Didn't he pull out that jacket vers' Ars' to be the ""old Hollow""?
What if I told y'all I brought the jacket I wore when we fought to finish this beatin' I owed Hollow?

{John John acts like he's going to pull out the jacket}

Got him!
Aye, nah, nah, nah, but truth be told Hollow, we ain't really scrap dawg
I mean, you swung, missed, I swung, hit and broke the mirror wit'chu, that's all
As far as Calicoe jumpin' in? That was a fact, y'all
Ayo, Twork, they ain't know it was me
Standin' over the body with my glasses and my hat off!
I'm only here 'cause I'm gettin' that cash!
It's a body, and it's time for you to get in that bag!
Matter of fact, scratch that
Can't even use that slogan, it doesn't feel right
'Cause I already whipped that ass - in real life!
Time, nigga!

[Round 1: Hollow Da Don]
Yoooooooooo!
I said, Hollow Da Don in London, versus-
I'm 'bout to fuck you up, nigga!
Y'all really gon' call him ""John John"" when he get split in two
Get the blade from my nigga in London {*clap-clap*}
And that leads (Leeds) to a liver pool (Liverpool)!
How dare you call me scared? You emotional fool
I'm only raisin' awareness with a .9, cause that's my promotional tool
You had your gums bumpin', sayin' I'm scared but done nothin'
'Til he finally get a Hollow, now John John the one duckin'
Nigga, I got somethin' that I owed John!
So I load up with the old jawn!
And take my shot, close-range like the old John!
Flip his shit, 'cause he got somethin' that he owe Hollow
So I load up with the old Hollow
But this time, tape on the handle
Naomi Campbell: it's the old model
From a block up, I can spot ya like cop lights
With that r-r-r-r-r-r-RAKA, BAKA, that was not nice
I ain't toleratin' no disrespect, I'm not playin' tonight
I'm givin' you one warning, John John...I'm not sayin' it twice!
I know y'all love that old Hollow but all in all
Life changed, I became more mature
I had a son, and many nights, I ignored him
Focused on that Parmesan (palm of John's) so I wanna say this here tonight...
I'm sorry, John
It's Dad!
Y'all remember doin' impersonations on Grind Time and I said, ""Oh, it's just a fad.""
It's Dad!
Y'all remember when you called me when you made it to URL and I said, ""Give it everything you had""?
It's Dad!
I mean, you came into this game as my son
Wanted to be Wade to my Lebron, so he named himself ""Da Don""
But I'm Hollow, you John
You Marlon, I'm Shawn
I'm B.I.G, you Shyne
If I get big, you shine
You Gain if I tied (Tide)
You Odom, I'm Shaq
You Nordstrom, I'm Saks
I'm Polo, you Chaps
How the fuck is we a match?
I mean, he even got pictures of me when I was a Wildcat on guard (God)
But I'm his idol, ain't I suppose to be on John Wall?
Don't lie, fam', I'm the nigga you've been chasin' for awhile
The man done studied every bar I land (island)
I hate he (Haiti) came in wit' my style
Nigga, Summer Madness, I battled Hitman, my name was known
In battle rap and the streets, that's how I caught a case for slangin' zones
Then I found out Smack Illuminati, down with Skull & Bones
'Cause I came home Summer Madness 2 y'all had made my clone
That's when you thought you was gonna be Smack gunner
Shit, he was even sayin' ""Roc won't stay""
Y'all could've paid a few Gs (Fugees), he still won't trade John for Tay (Forté)
That's cause you came into my name without payin' homage
My nigga, that's like Isiah Thomas comin' in the league sayin', ""Fuck Isiah Thomas""
I mean, Surf said you donned his [?]
Lux said the Don King, they was turnin' my name slick
But you fuck around, annnd...did a permanent name-flip
When you type the letter ""H"" into searches
The word ""Hollow"" emerges
You press 'Space' and move the cursor, then ""Da Don"" will surface
I'm more important than any ""How"" question, ""Halloween"" or ""Hollow Earth"" is
He worship, to the point I got Loyalty Over Money he got Bars Over Bullshit
Same logo
I got ""I'm not excited"" he got ""Shrug Life""
I do one round with Pat Stay, he do one round wit' Pat Stay
I do 106, bro this shit is annoying
But, it wasn't until I seen him against PC doin' torture shit like Jason Voorhees
That's when I was fully convinced he Jason Bourne'd me
But he gon' say, ""You got Rocko Da Don and Polow Da Don""
But in battle rap you only got me
You seen my highlights, you seen my pace and then copied
I'm sure when you made the discovery, you were Shocked G
But I got my name from Makaveli Da Don you better 'Pac me
He even let niggas call him the Dininon
Oooow that shit is wrong
But you're such a follower you moved to Atlanta when you was little John (Lil' Jon)
He seen me against Clips, givin' him the business loan
After that, I was passin' Roc(k) like a kidney stone
Then I did small room, had to get in my zone
Now they got me battlin' a nigga that look like he could fix my phone!
You see how he diss me for L.O.M.? But that ain't what I got on
I switched it cause I'm dippin' in HiddenLabelClothing.com
You wish I was done, nigga not now!
You wanted to go unlimited so I'ma go off the top now
I said, I let the fo'-fo' go, pulled it on him, he like, ""Oh, no, bro!""
He sound like Smack durin' Arsonal and Twork: ""I don't want no mo' smoke!""
Then they said why they booked him here
I said, ""Yeah, I don't know why they booked you here, 'cause you really steal bars.""
I had to tell the venue to really chill y'all like, ""John John's in town he might steal The Steel Yard.""
So you know who to call if a theft's involved
Aye, London, watch out, he might steal the D-O-N from y'all
I said he wanted to go unlimited, Smack, so I'mma go off the top now
Nigga I can rap about street shit, I really had to tote the pound
With an AR the size of International P, I gotta hold it down
It's funny I mention ARP cause Mook last battle we couldn't play the joint
Talkin' 'bout he Michael Jordan...in Space Jam cause he gotta reach just to make a point
He can't take a hard loss and you'll take an easy win quickly
Actin' like you bury Rum, please have some dignity (dig Nitty)
I'll catch you at the intersection
Bullets enter sections, leave his body in a section
That means if it's a green light, my people blast him
He'll slow down like a yellow when he seen the ratchet
The Glock had the beam attachment
Niggas usually stop when they see red that mean people passin'
So don't worry 'bout his next round and if y'all act like the fake Don winnin'
Then I'll be the reason to piece (peace) to John Lennon
Loyalty Over Money man
[Round 2: John John Da Don]
Now when they first announced this battle was booked in the UK
I was told- y'all favorited him more, so they didn't know how I would look in the UK
But due to Hollow graphic (holographic) bars, he may shine
But I ain't shook in the UK
Cause it was time me and this Gor-Don Ram see (Gordon Ramsey)
I told y'all I'ma cook in the UK
So hit the lights, close the curtain, this where the show stop
No pork, no lamb, but today we makin' GOAT chop, just for you K
But for you? K already cold cock
Before the shot: Code Red
After the shot: Don't Flop
Fuck if he doin' me a favor, nobody asked you to
I feel like whatever y'all got between y'all
That's Smack and you
No need a match for Mook? You don't need to look no further
Cause after I take this shot with a Hollow, close range, chances are I'm gettin' booked for murder
Stupid guy, why would you take this battle knowin' you would die
You plan on takin' DJ Khaled's son to court? Cause that's suicide (sue Asahd)
$40,000 for Lux, yeah right, maybe 25
I guess it's true I am denying Hollow cost (holocaust) I figured you (Jew) would lie
How can y'all not see (Nazi)

[Hollow puts up a sign that says ""That Sounds Familiar""]

I'm sick, and what I really discovered? Concentrate on ya camp
Cause if I spread one germ, many (German) will suffer and it'll be another World War too (II)
Millions will get killed, the plot was fake, but who the reparations go to is real (Israel)
I've seen you get your uppercut then another cut, then another cut
Yo Tay Roc, I see you had problems gettin' ya seat belt to buckle up
Aye, but the Summer's up, it's still Madness
So let me twerk (Twork) that line, I'm Strapped In
Cause what I pull from the shoulder, buckle and click, mine work just fine
You see dude a bitch, actin' gay, you look pissed
Y'all the break out, lose the grip, grab the blade, use a pick
Madden play, you should quit and that's okay
Just let ya guy know (Gyno) I'll pick apart a pussy if you the risk (uterus) I have to take
Cause as of late, you couldn't Roc(k) wit' Tay and barely Surf with Tsu
Just because you was Loaded for Lux don't mean you Murda Mook
You lost ya Arsonal and only had one Clip for Charlie
Let Dizaster ruin your world then Pat Stay for the party
Let's talk now, go 'head and say how Bullpen ain't doin' well
And how I'm losin' all my top battlers to the URL
Cause I told 'em, ""Fuck the PG's"" when I'm from the PG's, you sound stupid now
Cause if the sky's the limit, what's there for you to prove in (Proving) Grounds?
Do y'all see the vision? I went from lost to a boss, it's the ascension
Since the beginning, I took every name on them contracts Beasley sent in
All I did was play chess, you know, with two of the most important pieces switchin'
That's cause I knew callin' out the cast'll (castle) put a rook in a king position
Now look at me
Became everything they said I couldn't be
Wasn't 'Started From The Bottom' yours first for you to cook and eat?
But I guess a Don is (Adonis) Drake's son cause he took the beat
Now he tellin' stories how he got at a Don just to push a tee (Pusha T)
But worry 'bout the bars, don't worry what he got on
But if you is worried, don't go to LOMclothing.com
Cause that shit is not bomb, whoever buys that shit got the worst taste
And if you ain't want us to worry 'bout what you got on, then why the fuck you put it on in the first place?
Yeah I peeped ya little charity work, that's such a bogus scam, I know ya plan
Raise ya company awareness to the local fans
But you'd rather feed a random homeless man than to help ya mother own some land
How is it Loyalty Over Money when you disown ya fam' to promote ya brand?
Why you never do that shit in Queens?
If you really care, just take a look at Hollow 'Gram (hologram), he was never really there
But ya hollow's give back in a different way? That's how you say the line?
Okay then fine, but my Hollow's take backs like you gave it away then changed ya mind
Hold on, hold on

{Fake chokes for 14 seconds}

Hold on, hold on, my fault y'all, I got it
I didn't mean to keep everybody waitin'
But I promise that wasn't a choke, y'all just didn't peep the body language
I did this, this, this then this, is it clear now?
That's cause he knows (nose), before I (eye), take any lip he gettin' aired (ear'd) out
BAOW!
I'm only here cause I'm gettin' that cash
This is a body and it's time for you to get in that bag
Matter of fact, scratch that, can't even use that slogan, doesn't feel right
Cause I already whipped that ass in real life
Time

Quality over quantity, he can rap all night

[Round 2: Hollow Da Don]
I punched you dead in yo' motherfuckin' face nigga
And you went to Twitter to outburst
Well tell Smack, ""Lock us in a room"", let's see who comin' out first
I punched a nigga in his shit like, ""Yo, I'm not no bitch""
One hook had his mouth off like a Chinese flick
Here go a one Hollow mid-round off the top flips
Let's play Swear To God, nigga
Swear to God Calicoe ain't snuff you?
Shut the fuck up nigga he lumped you!
Swear to God Mike Moon ain't punch you?

[JJDD]
I don't know who that is

[Hollow]
Shut the fuck up, nigga he Homer Simpson Duff'ed you
Swear to God my man MB&B ain't rush you?

[JJDD]
Swear to God

[Hollow]
So my point is, how you beat me up when niggas actually jumped you?
That Worldstar shit would never happen nigga
It was sad as shit but it's cool
I'm peaceful now so let's get past the fist (pacifist)
I'm the only battle rapper that got the same nigga from him, from his first battle, what I'm lyin' for?
But where's Swag Inc? Where's the niggas behind you when you battled B-Magic?
Where's Syahboy?
Hold on, that's your 2 on 2 partner, I know he gotta be beside ya boy
John John I'm way in the back and I still can't find ya boy
But I'm disloyal
They said, ""John John being aggressive"" but he mad we ain't looked at equally
You're such on a low frequency you gotta scream just to speak to me
See all this battle rap persona shit, you done took it too far
How you gonna stand up here and tell me 'bout me nigga
When you don't know who the fuck you are?
John McGee, born in Yonkers, left a little after 8
So how you claimin' School Street when nigga you ain't graduate?
By 15 he was on the road seeing fame for free
Actin' like ya upbringing was So So, yeah cause you grew up under Jermaine Dupri
So you tellin' me when it's beef you had to call Bow?
And you being down with So So Def explains why you act like Da Brat you are now
All they'll say is, ""Hollow won't battle. Surf won't battle me.""
All we hear is John complain and watch John campaign like he fuckin' John McCain
I should break ya legs just for steppin' in my lane
And smack JD while screamin' ""Money Ain't A Thang!""
I wondered how he knew JD and Bow Wow, I thought it was through his hustle, puttin' in mad pain
You ain't grind to get on TV? Oh I guess it's all part of the rap game
Well hi John, I ain't made enough, so I'm still liable to do crazy stuff
Like I'll pay a nigga to beat yo' ass...then help break it up!
Nigga I could damage anything he did or said, you're probably a lame
Bad bitch with a big forehead, I'm goin' out with a bang
I know it just sound like me barkin'
But I'm the butcher and he's sleepwalkin' through a meat market
James Earl Jones, let's do some deep talkin'
I think awkward like Steve Hawking in Stephen King's office
Like what if everything we been on had been wrong?
What if the Devil is good? What if cigarettes help you live long?
What if Mike never changed his skin tone?
What if John John the real Don?
What if God is bad?
Y'all catch that? That's Pastor Troy, y'all know Pastor Troy?
Well that's legit, I know he caught it, he's a bar thief he won't let me get past the (pastor) flip
I mean, I know y'all gon' be like, ""Not this angle"" but nigga yeah
This guy's a thief, London if he was part of the Great Train Robbery
C'mon Johnny, that's how you got poppin', please
You looked at the Lifestyle Of The Rich & Famous then rob and (Robin) leech (Leach)
I actually wrote down every bar he every stole

{Hollow brings out a scroll}

Unfortunately, it's too long to scroll
But stop actin' like you're up (Europe) when you're scared of heights
I should give him an eye (Eiffel) full just for being a parasite (Paris site)
Greaseball (Greece) , you'll rush a (Russia) scheme with some bars he found
Lookin' at up and comers that's Hungry and then mark (Denmark) it down
I should drag him through Prague, then across the pond cause he don't have a check (Czech)
Talkin' 'bout a wager, nigga you don't have a rack (Iraq) to bet (Tibet)
I told him I could wait (Kuwait), but in due time, in the end (Indian) I still told dude, ""Bye"" (Dubai)
See that last scheme was important to see
I dragged him through Europe then Asia to show y'all catchin' a body in another country is not foreign to me
Nigga ya flow {snoring} boring to me
Y'all know how we got money for battle rap?
He got us all together, he said I could make some quick cash
""You see these cars behind me? You see these books? I could help you get rich fast
Us brothers gotta stick together let our melanin gleam.""
I said, ""Ain't this a bitch. A conscious brother studyin' Egypt while doing pyramid schemes
Y'all know how I got money before battle rap? I had to slang butter
Nigga judge cook a biscuit from scratch like Martin Payne mother
If they caught us with the white we blew (blue) 'fore it changed colors
So now the D sit in the lobby like the Wayans Brothers
I swear to God don't fuck with him
I'm doin' some damage that insurance ain't coverin'
It won't be fun but they'll be fun (fund) raisin' and GoFund'ing him
Once I put him down to Earth it's so humblin'
Nigga fuck you, fuck what you got on, and I fucked ya mom
While you was locked up by the way, I don't know if you knew that
I said, John John don't fuck with him
I'll clicka clicka buckin' him
I'll put a nigga face on the bag like Uncle Ben
By the way my brother dipped
I know ya mother been wonderin' where your uncle been
Lately I been on some other shit
I seen evil like Cousin It but eat people like Brotha Lynch
Lately I've been buggin' quick
I got a fuckin' stick, the bottom got a rubber grip
Sound like a plummer's kit, boy I'm comin' up wit' shit
I said he gon' diss me L.O.M. but that ain't what I got on
I switched it cause I'm dippin' in HiddenLabelClothing.com

[Round 3: John John Da Don]
This the battle for the name, right?
Nah see, y'all gots to chill
Yeah I know, they booked Da Don versus Da Don that headline the bill
Ever wonder who got the name and who havin' problems still?
We just established he swung on me, this nigga tried to steal Da Don for real
Nah, what the fuck have I ever done to you?
Did I threaten ya life or somethin'?
Have I ever pulled a gun on you?
So what you throw that punch to prove?
See any card he pulled a real Donald Trump it can show this pussy not untouchable
He was scared I'd replace him, to bad you can't avoid that
So when it's all said and done, I'd probably be the one to employ Smack
The way ya voice cracks, you should get some bed rest more fam'
Cause if you wasn't so Sleepy Hollow, you'll probably come off the head less horse
Man you can't rap

{Hollow pulls out a sign that says He Stole That}

Man you can't rap, you just do a lot of rambling well
See me I got the total package to address whoever's stampin' this male (mail)
Remind you of that first L.O.M. shirt that he managed to sell
Cause in so many words, I'm designed to hand you an L
I can punch, scheme, angle, flippin' bars is my go to
Remember I'm Shang Tsung, I can kill you witcha own moves
That was old school
These days I'm more versatile
But since you took it past rap, we gon' get more personal
When ya sister boyfriend beat her ass you wasn't thinkin' 'bout hurtin' a nigga
It was Hoffa that came through ready to put somebody in the dirt for the nigga
It's like God tried reversing the picture
Cause how you go from helpin' ya sister with her math homework
To bringing Math home to help put in work for ya sister?
That was ya guy, he would ride, to the pop of the wheels
When he got jumped out in Cali, whatchu do? Take a pic' with the op' for a film
If that was me? Shit, you said it, I'm John John, I'm known to slide wit' the steel (steal)
Fuck a Joseph Khan movie, Dizaster should've got Bodied for real
But you booked a battle wit' him and kept a secret 'bout that
You ain't even let ya man know when it was goin' down so he could bounce back
It's only science, history and literature, when he's speakin' 'bout class
That's these L.O.M. niggas, yeah, Leavin' Out Math
He was mad when we battled cause Hollow told him we was beefin'
Well on my mother's son, until you threw that punch I didn't know that we was beefin'
But you said on AngryFan you wanted to punch me in my mouth cause I told you to ""suck my dick"" on Twitter
Well excuse me Hollow, what I meant was, tell ya mother to suck my dick you bitch ass nigga
The next time y'all see Math, y'all get this message to him
Cause I'm the real reason Hollow left NYB, let's get this settled as men
Has nothing to do with Math, Cortez, D. Chamberz or the rest of they friends
Nah I'm lyin', cause it was after our little scuffle he ain't want nothin' to do with hands (Hanz) ever again
So don't tell me, this the nigga you gon' let ya children idolize
Either y'all believe them idol lies or watchin' him with idle eyes
You played yourself, by several accounts, he think he Vada Fly
Headshot, he'll go from ""I'm not excited"" to ""I'm not alive""
But I wanna apologize, to my ex, that said I hit her and played a helpless role
Even though she attacked me, I still could've showed more self control
It hurt my soul, when I seen all them people switch up
Cause where was that energy when y'all heard I beat this bitch up?
You hypocrites, I don't condone domestic violence in the thinnest bit
But you do, cause when I watch ya battles all your punches hit or (a) miss
That's why he need these antics, the fan got no poise
You like to think outside the box, cool, BAOW! Now you ain't got no choice
So it don't matter if you rip ya shirt, switch ya merch or hit the Earth
Cause real niggas only respect the bars when you spit ya verse
So when this battle dropped for the YouTubers to click and search
Comments gon' read, ""Nice try Hollow. But it didn't work.""
Like when you put that intercom in the generator without knowin' what that does to ya enemies
Wait a minute...I get it, you put an intercom in a generator cause you was tryin' to get a buzz off of energy?
Silly me, tryin' to sell that bullshit hopin' someone else will buy it
You should put a ventilator in a refrigerator
What that do? I dunno but he dumb enough to try it
But you can have them roastin' sessions
I ain't into joke professions
I'm loadin' weapons like vape pens, you could get smoked in seconds
I could teach you a thing or two 'bout how to hold a Wesson
Right, you wanna stretch him?
Hold it downward dawg (dog) I'm givin' yoga lessons
So whoever think we came for a fight
He tried that...made the biggest fuckin' mistake of his life
Now please don't say the John if you ain't sayin' it twice
And if you don't add the Da Don
(You ain't sayin' it right!)
Goodnight man

[Round 3: Hollow Da Don]
Dear Stan, this is actually not one of them rounds where I talk to him, unfortunately
This actually the round where I talk to me
And I ask, ""How did I create this hate?""
Maybe I ain't embrace you in ways you made it safe
And I was angry about the name, okay
Buy you can't have me named as prey while I'm movin' with amazin' ways
You want the ""Da Don"" then have it
But not before I give John 3:16's like John is Catholic
Or behead him in front of y'all now John The Baptist
I DiVinci'd the damn Code, I won't let my face show like Basquiat til a grand show
Paint the wall wit' him, then tell my nigga in the van, ""Go"" (Van Gogh)
Fuck the gun bars, yo stop my time
You beatin' bitches you bitch ass nigga?
You hittin' on women you bitch ass nigga?
I'm just jokin', cause I'm no longer a tough guy, that's not my line
Plus he not Joe Budden and there's not no time
My nigga you went from stealin' bars to stealin' broads
Let's take that further
He black like a cat burglar, beat her back like she Nat Turner
Not only did he get domestic violence, he got aggravated with assault, that's worser
Actin' like she's your wall then you flat Earth'd her
He even said, ""She put up money for Bullpen Battle League"", she was the stack earner
She put money in the pot, made you hot, and how'd you get her back? Burn her (burner)
Bro, he beat her ass so much he can't even lift his arm
He be like, ""BITCH WHAT YOU FLINCHING FOR?""
Mind you, Chelsea 4'11"" and he's 6 foot 4
See the problem is, he never learned responsibility or accountability
She beggin' him like, ""John, help me with the utilities.""
You lost your freedom over your emotions how [?]
While she out here wearin' the pants like Hillary
Then he found a number, that's why he beat her
That's what he had to wonder
Why she stabbed him in the back?
Cause dependin' on how you act, you punch her (acupuncture)
I blame his mother, cause he got his game from a woman
He got his traits from a woman
He even complain like a woman
He even chase another man for his name like a woman
Jay-Z said, ""a male shouldn't be jealous that's a female trait""
Oh you mad I get 30 for a battle and you get 8?
No, I said he get 30'd for a battle and you get (ate)
At 21 you started dissin' me, 22 he's still dissin' me
23 and 24 I'm thinkin', ""This some good publicity.""
I said, by 25 he smoked his first blunt
Had his first gun at 26
Middle man to quarter pound for 27, now he thinkin' he Money Mitch
At 28 he's still lyin' 'bout throwin' me through a mirror, it adds up
Cause that broken mirror actually gave YOU seven years of bad luck
I said fuck that, I'll leave a message and get back to him
Like {beep} I'll do voodoo, I'll take a patch of him and start detaching him
You'll really live up to your acronym once I make half of him
Shhh shhh, get ya body sprayed I ain't askin' (Axe'ing) him

Treat you like a friend

If you be the cash, I'll be the rubber band
You be the match, I will be a fuse, boom!
Painter baby, you could be the muse
I'm the reporter, baby you could be the news
'Cause you're the cigarette and I'm the smoker
We raise a bet 'cause you're the joker
Checked off, you are the chalk and I could be the blackboard
And you can be the talk and I could be the walk

[Chorus]
Even when the sky comes falling
Even when the sun don't shine
I got faith in you and I
So put your pretty little hand in mine
Even when we're down to the wire babe
Even when it's do or die
We can do it baby simple and plain
'Cause this love is a sure thing

You could be the lover I'll be the fighter babe
If I'm the blunt, you could be the lighter babe, fire it up!
Writer babe, you could be the quote
If I'm the lyric baby, you could be the note, record that!
Saint, I'm a sinner, prize, I'm a winner, and it's you
What can I do to deserve that?
Paper baby, I'll be the pen
Say that I'm the one 'cause you are ten
Real and not pretend, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Even when the sky comes falling
Even when the sun don't shine
I got faith in you and I
So put your pretty little hand in mine

We can do it, babe, simple and plain

[Bridge]
Rock with me, baby
Let me hold you in my arms, talk with me, yeah
Rock with me, baby
Let me hold you in my arms, talk with me, baby
This love between you and I, as simple as pie, baby
It's such a sure thing, it's such a sure thing
Oh, is it a sure thing? (It's such a sure thing) Yeah

Even when the sky comes falling
Even when the sun don't shine
I got faith in you and I
So put your pretty little hand in mine

In it he sings:\n\nGirl, your memory won’t ever haunt me\nCause I don’t love you, and now if you’ll buy that\nI got some ocean front property in Arizona\n\nFrank’s usage of Arizona in the first verse can also be attributed to this song, and in a similar fashion he builds on it by mentioning a beach house in Idaho. Yet, neither of these states have an oceanfront.\n\nThis points out to wordplay on “lying” since he apparently isn’t telling the truth. It’s also pretty clear Frank doesn’t actually own a fighter jet, but he accurately compares an unrequited love to having a jet you can’t fly. The cover of the single has Frank sitting in a Go-Kart, which is a visualization of this line.\n\nHowever, the motive behind lying is unclear; he could be doing it sarcastically to assert the person he loves them, or it’s his way of wiggling out of a rejection.']]), ('I’m thinkin’ ’bout you, ooh no, no, no\n I’ve been thinkin’ bout you, you know, know, know\n I’ve been thinkin’ bout you, do you think about me still?\n Do ya, do ya?', [['Frank believes his first love is someone he’ll spend his life with, but he isn’t sure if they feel the same way. The fact that the lyrics don’t tells us if they’re even in a relationship anymore shows how complicated the situation is.\n\nWhile it’s not clear if “Nikes” uses the same relationship as an inspiration, it discusses a similar situation:\n\nHe don’t care for me\nBut he cares for me\nAnd that’s good enough']]), ('Yes, of course, I remember, how could I forget (How could I forget?) how you feel?

In his open letter on Tumblr, Ocean revealed his first love was a man, which asserts the idea that this song is about a male partner.\n\nFurthermore, the road changing from color to black and white represent them sticking together until gay people get the right to marry. They’ll wear black and white, like a bride and groom, instead of the rainbow-colored LGBT flag.\n\nTo bring the song full-circle, the road changing colors is another reference to “The Wizard of Oz,” in which the movie changes to black and white once Dorothy heads back home from Oz.\n\n\n\nGay marriage was ruled legal nationwide in the US in 2015.']]), ('A tornado flew around my room before you came\n Excuse the mess it made, it usually doesn’t rain in\n Southern California, much like Arizona\n My eyes don’t shed tears, but boy, they pour when', [['Frank’s room represents his life; he’s well aware it was messy and out of order before he met his significant other, who brought peace into his life. However, they’ve broken up and it makes him cry which is as rare as rain in California and Arizona. Interestingly, it was thought his second LP would be titled Boys Don’t Cry, but it ended up being the name of the magazine that went along with Blonde.\n\n“It Never Rains in Southern California” is a song that tells a story of a musician who moved to Cali in pursuit of a music career. The tornado is one of two references to the classic novel/movie “The Wizard of Oz” in this song, in which the main character Dorothy is swept away into the Land of Oz by a tornado.\n\nOnce you put those two references together, and mix water with a tornado, you get a highly influential event that happened to Ocean. After hurricane Katrina hit his hometown of New Orleans, Frank moved to Los Angeles to chase his dream of being a musician.\n\nFurthermore, “It Never Rains in Southern California” contains the following lyrics:\n\nIt never rains in California, but girl, don’t they warn ya?\nIt pours, man, it pours\n\nIn the mentioned lines, “girl” is a vocative, and “man” is just a phrase that is there to amplify the meaning. However, Frank’s usage of “boy” in this verse could be interpreted as both, and that means the love he’s talking about could be male or female. Note that when “Thinkin Bout You” came out as a single it was still unknown if he was straight or not. Prior to the release of channel ORANGE, he came out as bisexual.']])]",-0.8722,-0.8722,0.1826,Sad

I had a longer verse, I started just talking shit after that and I just went off. I’m glad that it was shorter because all the other stuff that I said didn’t really make sense at all.

Beating on his chest like a bongo
He understands she's coming from a hurt place

Doesn't get jealous, doesn't break trust
Doesn't call her, ""Ho"" after hang-ups
Give her everything she ever wanted
And even though she still feels haunted

[Laughs] I’d rather write something where my eyes are forward, not so much internal. I hope it makes people happy and creates a difference in some way, just by people recognizing themselves in the song.\n\nThe song has also been questioned to be about Armstrong’s battle with drug addiction, which is true but also not. Armstrong spoke about this idea in a radio interview:\n\nIt’s about losing something…where the chaos of life makes sense. Life isn’t perfect, it’s better than that. I you can survive through some of this stuff, you find out who you really are, whether its drug addiction, losing a family member or dealing with somebody who has some serious personality issues. It goes from the life of a junkie and a gambler to the life of a single mother to the life of a soldier…[it’s about] how we’re all intertwined with that…its universal.\n\nWhich leads me to discuss how this song deserves a spot here. This song not only relates to me but many of Green Day’s fans, whether they’re recovering from an addiction or depression. This song can give them hope for a brighter tomorrow or give them inspiration to be able to say, “I’m still breathing on my own.”']]), ('Green Day - “Bang Bang”', [['The second track and first single released from Green Day’s twelfth studio album Revolution Radio.\n\nThough not an extremely extremely political jam compared to their rock opera American Idiot back in 2004, the song does discuss many details of mass shootings in the US and around the world.\n\nWhen asked about “Bang Bang” in a Rolling Stone interview, vocalist/guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong responded:\n\nIt’s about the culture of mass shooting that happens in America mixed with narcissistic social media. There’s this sort of rage happening, but it’s also now being filmed and we all have ourselves under surveillance. To me, that is so twisted. To get into the brain of someone like that was freaky. It freaked me out. After I wrote it, all I wanted to do was get that out of my brain because it just freaked me out.']]), ('YEAHTIM - “No More Staffin’ On RG”', [['Is it too late to put this number one?']]), ('Rich Chigga - Who That Be', [['Name a more iconic song that came out this year.

Hello? Yeah, I just walked in
Yeah, I'm good… You still working?
Tonight… Right now? Did I go out?
Yeah, I went out, I went…
I went to a couple of clubs
I never went to bed, shit…
Wine or water
You said something about a cold drink?
I don't know, I'm delirious

[Verse 1: Drake]
Cups of the rosé
Bitches in my old phone
I should call one and go home
I've been in this club too long
The woman that I would try
Is happy with a good guy
But I've been drinkin' so much
That I'ma call her anyway, and say

[Chorus: Drake]
Fuck that nigga that you love so bad
I know you still think about the times we had
I say fuck that nigga that you think you found
And since you picked up, I know he's not around
[Bridge: Drake & Ericka Lee]
Are you drunk right now?
I'm just sayin' you could do better
Tell me, have you heard that lately?
I'm just sayin' you could do better
And I'll start hatin' only if you make me

[Verse 2: Drake]
Uh, cups of the XO
All my people been here
I see all of her friends here
Guess she don't have the time to kick it no more
Flights in the morning
What you doin' that's so important?
I've been drinkin' so much
That I'ma call you anyway, and say

And I'll start hatin' only if you make me
[Verse 3: Drake]
I think I'm addicted to naked pictures
And sitting talking 'bout bitches that we almost had
I don't think I'm conscious of makin' monsters
Outta the women I sponsor 'til it all goes bad
But, shit, it's all good
We threw a party, yeah, we threw a party
Bitches came over, yeah, we threw a party
I was just calling, ‘cause they were just leavin'
Talk to me, please, don't have much to believe in
I need you right now, are you down to listen to me?
Too many drinks have been given to me
I got some women that's livin' off me
Paid for their flights and hotels, I'm ashamed
Bet that you know them, I won't say no names
After a while, girl, they all seem the same
I've had sex four times this week; I'll explain
Havin' a hard time adjustin' to fame
Sprite in that mixture
I've been talkin' crazy, girl, I'm lucky that you picked up
Lucky that you stayed on
I need someone to put this weight on
""Well, I'm sorry""

She claims that Drake texted her messages like, “U basically made that song” and “It’s shit without you.” While Drake has reportedly offered her a percentage of the publishing money, Lee seeks credit as a co-writer of the song and is seeking other damages.\n\nThe case was settled the following year out of court.\n\nDrake later went on to mention her on “Redemption” in 2016, saying:\n\nErika sued me and opened a business']]), ('I hope no one heard that\n I hope no one heard that\n ‘Cause if they did, we gonna be in some trouble\n We really gonna be in some trouble, trouble', [['He hopes nobody heard this white girl say the word because there may be an altercation over its usage. The ending is supposed to illustrate that he feels more alone at this party of distanced, hostile people than he would if he were actually alone, and it’s made him even more depressed than he already was about missing his ex.']]), ('Her white friend said, “You niggas crazy”', [['The word “nigga” is considered a reclamation word, heavily rooted in black culture and speech, so it’s noteworthy for Drake to mention her being white because it is considered taboo for non-black people to use the word (especially white people), even if it is said in jest.']]), ('I’m just sayin’ you could do better\n Tell me, have you heard that lately?\n I’m just sayin’ you could do better\n And I’ll start hatin’ only if you make me', [['He actually implying that he himself is better, only because he is drunk, he is not saying her boyfriend is a bad boyfriend, as earlier stated in the lyrics, he is  implying that her current guy isn’t bad , just that he’s better.\n\nThe song continues with sections in which Drake tries to coerce his unwilling ex over the phone.  His efforts ultimately go unrewarded.']]), ('Are you drunk right now?', [['Indeed he is, and she can tell because such blunt honesty rarely comes from someone sober.\n\nThis is a sample from a convo with Ericka Lee. Lee sued Drake for using her voice without her permission and excluding her from royalties, and they settled out of court.']]), ('Bet that you know them, I won’t say no names', [['He has been messing with girls within her circle, so instead of breaking up friendships, their names will remain anonymous.\n\nAlso, this is  a statement directed to the listener as if he doesn’t want to expose the girls who are living off of him to the rest of the world and embarrass them.']]), ('But I’ve been drinkin’ so much\n That I’ma call her anyway, and say', [['Here we see an unusually aggressive side of Drake as he claims to be better than any new guy in his ex’s life.\n\nThis may be a reference to Rihanna and her on-again-off-again relationship with Chris Brown—which ended on a bad note after a violent dispute. Though Drake and Rih were never official, it was rumored for years that they were dating.']]), ('Flights in the morning\n What you doin’ that’s so important?', [['Fun Fact: Drake tweeted this line a few weeks before dropping the song:\n\nhttp://twitter.com/#!/drakkardnoir/status/76950821367062529\n\nHe’s saying he feels hurt because he’s only here for tonight, he’s leaving in the morning, but the girl still isn’t interested in seeing him and she is acting like she is on the road all the time too.']]), ('Cups of the rosé', [['Rosé is a sparkling wine (and could come in a champagne variety).

And now I know relationship's my enemy
So stay away from me
I'm warning you
You try to fill the void with every man you meet
'Cause you're upset with me
I'm warning you

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause all the nights you slept alone dryin' your eyes
And all the nights you thought about takin' your life
'Cause if it's love you want again, don't waste your time
But if you call me up, I'm fuckin' you on sight

I don't wanna hurt you (ooh)
I don't wanna hurt you
I don't wanna hurt you (ooh)
I don't wanna hurt you

When you're with him, you close your eyes and think of me
Just call me up again
I'll make you weak
Girl, I'll come to put myself between your legs
Not between your heart
Can't you see?
[Pre-Chorus]
That all the nights you slept alone, dryin' your eyes ('cause of me, baby)
And all the nights you thought about takin' your life ('cause of me, baby)
If it's love you want again, don't waste your time (don't you waste)
But if you call me up, I'm fuckin' you on sight

One thing's for certain
Need you right here in my arms

I need you to hear me, baby

Wake up, love (Wake up, wake up, love)
These sheets won't comfort me
Please, wake up, love (Wake up, wake up, love)
I might just comfort me
But I just need you holdin' me
Show me some attention
I want you to wake up, love (Wake up)
Hear me, baby

[Verse 2: Teyana Taylor]
It's like a turban
I can wrap my head around this shit, but
I need your brown skin
I'm like India when I'm not fixed on you, woah, woah

Bright lights are only used for the dark, lil' mama
Drama gon' play her part, pain is art, lil' mama
It just get retouched, hung up on the walls
You wanna sell it later, then cool
We takin' it all lil' mama, it's real
I'd save you from a burnin' building
I'd wear the burns as gold medals, turn you on to remember
Even though you scarred me, I took it so I know the feelin'
But fuck it, let's build this bitch to ceiling
I'm really fuckin' with you
There's a whole lot more than a make up after break up
So don't fight back, just write back, baby
I know I demand a lot and you don't like that
So let's just leave the baggage
I'ma hop us on this flight back, you like that, right?

Ooh, I fall apart
Ooh, yeah, mmm, yeah

[Verse 1]
She told me that I'm not enough (Yeah)
And she left me with a broken heart (Yeah)
She fooled me twice and it's all my fault (Yeah)
She cut too deep, now she left me scarred (Yeah)
Now there's so many thoughts goin' through my brain (Yeah)
And now I'm takin' these shots like it's Novocaine, yeah

Ooh, I fall apart
Down to my core
Ooh, I fall apart
Down to my core
Ooh, didn't know it before
Surprised when you caught me off guard
All this damn jewelry I bought
You was my shorty, I thought

[Verse 2]
Never caught a feelin' this hard
Harder than the liquor I pour
Tell me you don't want me no more
But I can't let go, everybody told me so
Feelin' like I sold my soul
Devil in the form of a whore
Devil in the form of a whore
You said it, no, you said it
No, you said that shit, we'd be together, oh

Try to brush it off, but it keep on goin'
Covered in scars and I can't help showin'
Whippin' in the foreign and the tears keep rollin'

Try to brush it off, but it keep on goin'
All these scars, can't help from showin'
Whippin' in the foreign and the tears keep blowin', yeah

I mean I always loved like shiny stuff, that’s just like – you know what I’m into']]), ('Whippin’ in the foreign and the tears keep rollin’', [['Not even in his expensive foreign car can Post drive away from his problems and sadness.\n\n\n\nMalone is known for his penchant for expensive cars. This isn’t the first time that he’s talked about pricey rides; he has also done this in his feature on “Foreign” with Jazz Laser and Mally Mall.\n\nForeign, foreign, foreign, foreign\nYou get off early in the morning\nI be in valet, I’m cool with the drivers\nHe see my car and he already know it']]), ('Ice keep pourin’ and the drink keep flowin’', [['Post is shocked at the sudden loss of the woman he loves. Many people turn to drinking when they lose somebody, either through a breakup, death, or other circumstances. This can result from the inability to cope with stress, depression, and life in general.\n\nAs with many men before him, this woman leaving his life drives Post to drink away his pain. He tries to get past his feelings, but his willpower is no match for a cold glass of whiskey.']]), ('She fooled me twice and it’s all my fault (Yeah)', [['After he fell in love with her once, he should have learned from the experience of a previous break-up so he accepts responsibility for the pain he’s going through.

Russ would use another metaphoric lyric to weather in his 2020 track, “FOOT ON THE GAS”:\n\nI could never fold, I'ma go harder than ever\nI'ma make it through the pain, I'ma weather the weather\n\nInterestingly, Russ vocalized more weather-like lyrics to depict life in his 2016 track, “Manifest”:\n\nTook my mom with me\nLet her soak up all the sunshine\nLet her watch the rain stop\nAll because her son shined""]]), ('Lately I been feelin’ like I’m all alone\n Hotels and airplanes is what I call home\n I might need somebody, I don’t trust nobody\n So I guess I’m really on my own\n Lately I been feelin’ like I’m all alone\n Hotels and airplanes is what I call home\n I might need somebody, I don’t trust nobody\n So I guess I’m really on my own', [[""Loneliness is a common theme in Russ' discography. For example, we can see Russ feeling this way on his 2015 track “Lonely In Times Square”:\n\nWho would of thought that you can be lonely in Times Square?\nI never thought that I could be lonely in Times Square\nBut I’ve been dealing with some pain, and these distractions just ain’t enough\nAll this liquor, all this fucking, all these people, just ain’t enough\n\nAkin to the meaning of this song’s chorus, Russ' personal definition of being lonely stems from the idea of being surrounded by many people and yet still feeling isolated because nobody understands you:\n\nI wrote a song a long time ago that unfortunately predicted [how being surrounded by millions of people and yet feeling alone] called “Lonely in Times Square.“\n\nFurthermore, in an Instagram Live, we can hear Russ talking about his loneliness and one aspect it takes a toll on, similarly to the message in “Lonely In Times Square”:\n\n[My] lonely aspect comes from the constant undertone feeling of knowing that no one around you gets what the fuck is going on—as far as what’s going on in your life. They’re around; they see it, I talk to everyone every day, but I’m the only famous one in my circle.\n\nBecause of this, Russ escapes his life and its reality, staying in hotels and travelling frequently as a way of getting away from the problems. Russ' use of this metaphor about the homeliness of his luxuries suggests that he spends a lot of time doing these actions to the point that it’s a common routine.\n\nSimilarly, in his freestyle with K104, Russ used the same metaphor of how an airport feels homely:\n\nHartsfield-Jackson startin' to feel like a second home""]]), ('Rich is not on the surface, nah, it’s in you', [[""When riches aren’t “on the surface,” it alludes to how wealth should be perceived mentally rather than physically, further connecting “it’s in you” to refer to your mental state of mind.\n\nThis line has made frequent appearances in Russ' music, as he shared a similar sentiment in his 2014 song, “Comin Thru,” stating:\n\nSearching, saying for the longest, I’m gonna be rich any minute\nRich is just a state of mind, believe me, I’m in it\n\nThough, six years after “Comin Thru,” on his track, “Can’t Be Me,” Russ would continue to stick to this ethical advice:\n\nRich is in the mind, not in your wallet\nSo I gotta keep my mind right (Yeah)\nSo that my stars align (Yeah, ayy)""]]), ('California to clear my head\n Ignorin’ all my texts\n Y’all don’t get it anyway, anyway\n Zoned out, I should put my phone down\n I live on the road now\n Everything’s not glorious, glorious', [[""In Russ' 2018 small-hit, “Some Time,” we can see him needing time away from his phone:\n\nPlease don’t call my phone, I need some time\nJust to sit and think about my life\nIt’s been every day, nonstop, every night\nI just need some time, ooh\n\nThen again, he preaches this same sentiment of needed relaxation and not dealing with media:\n\nLet me live peacefully\nI might get rid of my phone so that nobody reaches me""]]), ('The arena’s the only time I ever sold out', [['“Selling out” is a term used to describe an artist or band that became more mainstream and commercial.

""Watch your step, you gon’ wake my mama and dad up""

We gon’ wake your neighbors
Turn your block club to my fan club
And that happen so fast
Damn, I'm glad I strapped up
Ask her when she finish, if she came
She said I lapped ya twice
Run it back for the dub, rematch
Flip the crib when we fuck, RE/MAX
It get hot than a mug, glass cup
You can ask her if I fuck, she gassed, huh
I gotta keep it a secret, I keep a key in my lower pocket
Inside a register below the lower octave
Dirty laundry in my closet, they be strung out on the street
Left to dry with drawers, sheets and no deposit
But I don’t gotta worry, put my hand on your mouth
Put my hands in your mouth, girl
We got plans at my house, you know the way up

The “plus ninety nine” also implies that in addition to having perfect ten looks, she has a great personality, adding to her overall value.\n\n\n\nIf this girl knew that she is more than a standard hot girl, she wouldn’t tolerate a man who cheats, she would go out and look for someone who deserves her.\n\nThis could also be interpreted as “she is valued at $1.09” [1 dime plus 99 cents] or, alternatively, 100 dimes, totaling at a grand $10.
