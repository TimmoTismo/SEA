I can't wait for you to come my way
I've been far away
But I'll keep running
Just to find a way to you till then

[Verse 1: Tarrek]
I've been running from it
Tired of running from it
Scared of feeling something
Now I'm stuck here tryna get up outta this hole
I tried to be strong
I tried to make it work but I've been feeling too numb
Skies are beating on me
Why'd you leave me lonely?
Feeling Whitney, Stoney
Now I'm stuck here wondering where I ever went wrong
How could I be strong?
I'm fighting for your love

I can't wait for you to come my way
I've been far away
But I'll keep running
Just to find a way to you till then
[Verse 2: Issac]
I don't see light in your love anymore
There ain't no reason to call in a fall
I don't like feelings and feeling like running from something
And feeling so out of control
I know that the feelings are gone
I'm spending too much time alone
I'm hoping you pick up the phone
And ring me when you wanna stay overnight
My shoulder's right
My baby's all that I want
And I play them, all of my favourite songs
That lady is my favourite one

I can't wait for you to come my way
I've been far away
But I'll keep running
Just to find a way to you till then

Ain't never gonna let you go
Got my heart NASCAR racing
Shine ain't never fading
He just left you hanging
Fiending for your love
All worth it for the waiting
Give you what you need
Take you where you want
Can't feel it when we're all alone
Know you're wanting something more
My heart is like an open door
Just ring me when you wanna go
[Break: Joseph]
I'll wait till you're home
Hold a place till you're coming home
Show you where the garden grows
Just ring me when you wanna go

The classic book Stone Butch Blues by Leslie Feinberg explores this identity and is well known within the queer community. There are nuances to this dynamic but based on the exploration of 1950s butch/femme dynamics in this song it seems like this is a pretty overt callout to a stone butch.']]), ('I hope that you’re happy with me in your life\n I hope that you won’t slip away in the night\n I hope that you’re happy with me in your life\n I hope that you won’t slip away\n I hate it when dudes try to chase me\n I love it when you try to save me\n ‘Cause I’m just a lady', [['I wrote the verse one coming out of the shower and I wrote the chorus melody by myself. Then I went into the studio, I called my engineer Mike Malgerhoff, and I was like, “We got to get in this weekend.” Basically the next day, the next two days, I went to the studio and was like, “Nick you got to come in here help me finish this shit.”\n\nNick came in and it was me, Nick and Mike, and we’re sitting there and I played him the verse and the chorus. He’s like, “Dude Fuck yeah.” Then  we were like the melodies are done, let’s just get the second verse and let’s get the chorus lyrics in. It really started verse one, chorus, and then we wrote verse two and the bridge obviously. It changed very little from the demo also. The song was recorded almost two years ago, and it really has stayed almost the same. Which makes me super happy because it’s my production. I worked with my two very good friends on it.\n\n“I hope that you’re happy with me in your life\nI hope that you won’t slip away""—that’s sad. That’s a sad lyric. The song is about love and fear and the way you present yourself in relationships. There’s a lot of uncertainty in the lyrics. ""Did you mean it when you said I was pretty?” And talking about someone not kissing you until you least expect it, it’s these moments of uncertainty that we all feel when we’re in love. I think that that lyric is just the summation of all of those feelings. “Are you gonna fucking leave me? Just want a heads up would be great ya know.”\n\nI love that its so matter of fact. When I listen back to it the bridge, it’s always like “Awe.” It’s like a moment of sad reflection.']]), ('That you didn’t wanna live in a city\n Where the people are shitty?', [['When I was writing that, I was writing it from the perspective of somebody who moved from New York to LA.

I just love that, “I don’t wanna live in a city where the people are shitty.” I felt that way about New York for a moment and now I’m nostalgic for it. I’m happy I’m back obviously.

I feel like a lady. Then I have these moments that are polar opposites, where I definitely feel more masculine and I wanted to play around with that. Its just a simple sentiment. When someone says something like, “You’re beautiful,” I find myself having those moments where like, “Oh my God they said that to me. She said I was pretty.”\n\nIt’s so simple, and I wrote this song with my really good friend Nick Long. I remember we wrote that line and we were like, “It’s so simple.

If I could use that religious imagery to talk about gay love because, there’s nothing different between gay people and straight people. I think that the issue is when these outside elements like religion and where you’re from come in to play. It is a conscious choice to use religious imagery.

FUCK YEAH!”']]), ('So tell me why my Gods look like you\n And tell me why it’s wrong', [['Yeah, the whole songs about being in love with this idea of a person and being in love with a figure and turning the person that you love into more of a shrine than an actual relationship. I think in that specific line, “tell me why my Gods look like you,” it’s like if you hold the person that you’re fucking, loving, dating, whatever, on that highest shelf, your adoration for them becomes greater than the actual relationship. I think that’s what that line’s about, just about really looking up to the person that you want romantically.']]), ('I love it when we play 1950', [['I think it’s an analogy. It’s a metaphor in the sense that I think I was using the idea of the way that queer people had to hide their love in history, throughout our history. Being a parallel to unrequited love. Feeling like somebody’s being cold to you in a public space. Somebody’s giving you the cold shoulder to bring you in more, and how that looks very similar to the way people once couldn’t be gay in public.

I wanted to pay tribute to that.']]), ('‘Cause I’m just a lady', [['Isn’t that funny? Because I’m not a lady.

I was in this environment where I was around all these kids who were also doing music. I knew I was gay. I knew what I wanted, but you have to remind yourself.

I feel like I in particular started to think more about my identity and how it sits in a room, and who’s observing it.\n\nI just had this moment where I was like, “I fucking hate it when dudes try to fuck me, but I also absolutely adore when ladies try to chase me.” That sentiment is pretty sick. I love that. I feel like a lot of women feel that way about attention.

During an interview with Genius, Lil Nas X explains how this individual invited him over via “DM,” and at the time, it had been a while since he’d visited anybody due to the COVID-19 pandemic. He explained how he also took time off from seeing friends and family due to his fears associated with COVID-19.']]), ('I wanna sell what you’re buyin’\n I wanna feel on your ass in Hawaii\n I want that jet lag from fuckin’ and flyin’', [['In the Genius Verified video for this track, Lil Nas X expands on these lines:\n\nThis is like where the song kind of turns more desperate almost, you know? And it’s very much a lust song. Okay, you’re buying this drug? I wanna give it to you, you know, or I wanna be that drug.']]), ('Tell me you love me in private', [['Many same-sex attracted people remain “closeted” about their sexuality out of fear of homophobia.\n\nIn some cases, the partner might think they’re ashamed or embarrassed to make things official. Many songs, such as Hayley Kiyoko’s “Curious”, have explored this idea before.\n\nLil Nas X himself has been open about his decision to come out. In an Instagram post announcing this song’s release, he wrote:\n\nI know we promised to die with the secret, but this will open doors for many other queer people to simply exist.\n\nAdditionally, this line carries the weight of the rest of the song referencing Christian homophobia and forbidden risky relationships taking place “behind closed doors”.']]), ('Never want the niggas that’s in my league\n I wanna fuck the ones I envy, I envy', [['In Nas X’s Genius Verified interview, he explains the line:\n\nAnd when I say envy, I don\'t mean somebody who may be above me professionally, or like, sexier than me or like stronger than me, It\'s just kind of like ""Okay, I love what this person is about, I love what this person is doing, I want this person."" If somebody is doing the exact same thing as me, it\'s like, ""Okay, I\'m good on you, I want this person right here""\n\n\nLil Nas X continues using language that invokes Biblical imagery with these lines that describe lust and envy. Both of these are considered part of the seven deadly sins, with lust being defined as the strong desire for sexual passion with someone other than a significant other, and envy is the strong desire for someone else’s possession or qualities. Lil Nas X could be referring to lusting after a man with better qualities than him, most likely appearance-wise or social standing.\n\nAlternatively, Lil Nas X could also be referring to a straight man as implied in the pre-chorus. “Out of my league” is a common phrase used to describe someone possessing many more attractive qualities than the speaker, usually referring to the fact that the “out of league” person wouldn’t want to date the speaker. Lil Nas X could also be referring to a baseball league as a metaphor, since baseball metaphors are often used to refer to sexuality (ex: “batting for the other team”). Ergo, a man out of Lil Nas X’s league could be a man who is not as confident and sure in his attraction to men.']]), ('A sign of the times every time that I speak\n A dime and a nine, it was mine every week\n What a time, an incline, God was shinin’ on me\n Now I can’t leave\n And now I’m actin’ hella elite', [['These lines show Lil Nas X reminiscing fondly on his experiences in the music industry.\n\nA “dime and nine” is equal to 19, which refers to the record-setting nineteen weeks Old Town Road was No. 1 on the Top 100 charts. No. 1 was his spot every week, and his growth in popularity was on an “incline”. “God shining” on someone is an expression used to refer to someone having good fortune.\n\nHowever, now that he is famous, how he acts and speaks will be watched by everyone and made him acting “elite” because of the fame he gained.\n\n“A sign of the times every time that I speak” is a reflection on how some publics point to him being openly gay as a sign of “the world falling apart”. Nas X has repeatedly acknowledged these sentiments toward him in the past and published several tweets (1, 2, 3 and 4) the day before MONTERO’s release, jokingly pokes holes in this homophobic logic.']]), ('Shoot a child in your mouth while I’m ridin’', [[""Lil Nas X is “riding” his partner while facing them during intercourse. He notes the action of “shoot[ing] a child” into his partner’s mouth, a euphemism for ejaculating into the other man’s mouth.\n\nIn the Genius Verified video for the track, Lil Nas X spoke on the nature and potential impact of this line:\n\nOkay, it’s about time that I say something out of pocket in a song. It’s like the exact same way when I put “I might bottom on the low, but I top shit” in “HOLIDAY,” you know? […] Let’s normalize having these fuckin' lines in songs the same way, you know, somebody might talk about fuckin' a girl or fuckin' a guy, you know, with opposite genders, you know?

He waits to be singled out by his own first name, Montero,  and be called back for further intimacy.\n\nIn an interview for Genius Verified, Nas X confirmed that “MONTERO” is a reference to Call Me By Your Name, a 2007 romantic novel about two male lovers, which was later famously adapted to film in 2017.\n\nFollowing the release of the track, Nas X wrote the following message on Twitter to his fourteen-year-old self, discussing homosexuality:\n\ni wrote a song with our name in it. it’s about a guy i met last summer…i know we promised to die with the secret, but this will open doors for many other queer people to simply exist.']]), ('Cocaine and drinkin’ with your friends\n You live in the dark, boy, I cannot pretend', [[""This individual participates in some of the darker things in life, like cocaine, and is perhaps unaware of Lil Nas X’s true feelings. The line is also a nod to the closeted nature of the individual.\n\nNas X explains the line in his Genius Verified video:\n\nYou know, when I got there, I saw the drugs and the alcohol, and I partake in the alcohol part at least. This is kinda like a double entendre kind of thing, ‘cause it’s like 'you live in the dark’, as in your life is not in a happy spot–or at least that’s what I’m receiving from you–and it’s also with these eyes that you’re makin' at me like you live in the dark–in the closet. I can’t pretend I don’t see you doin' this shit or I can’t pretend I don’t notice these things.\n\nAdditionally, Nas X teased this line on July 17th, 2020 and again in January 2021, ahead of the song’s release:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/LilNasX/status/1284221584270520320""]])]",-0.5556,-0.5556,0.7469,Happy

Most notably, he has worked extensively with the Make-a-Wish Foundation, which grants wishes to critically ill children. In August 2013, he broke the foundation’s record for most wishes granted by a musical artist. Other beneficiaries of Bieber’s time and/or money include the ACLU, PETA, and amfAR, an AIDS research charity to which Biebs donated $545,000 on a whim.\n\nIn February 2020, before the COVID-19 pandemic became an international crisis, Biebs donated $29,000 to Beijing Chunmiao Children Aid Foundation, sending a message of support on Instagram that foreshadowed the virus' worldwide impact:\n\nWatching the news I couldn’t imagine how scary it would be if a new disease was effecting [sic] my wife and my family and friends. China we stand with you as a collective humanity and have made a donation to support.\n\nBieber went on to release two charity singles to help curb the outbreak. In May 2020, he collaborated with Ariana Grande for “Stuck With U,” the proceeds of which benefitted the First Responders Children’s Foundation. In December 2020, he teamed up with a London choir comprised of nurses, doctors, and other health care workers to record a version of his September 2020 hit “Holy.” The proceeds benefitted the UK’s National Health Service.

I've been tryna call
I've been on my own for long enough

That could imply a reminiscence of feelings he had in his (fictional) past life, and the fact that he’s very sensitive towards women, and has always been.\n\nThis idea is somewhat confirmed in the chorus.']]), ('I’m running out of time\n ’Cause I can see the sun light up the sky', [['This line has several meanings:\n\nFirst, he alludes to Las Vegas again. As mentioned in the pre-chorus of the song, Abel has a special emotional connection to the city. He recalls it here and automatically combines it with the chorus:\n\nNo, I can’t sleep until I feel your touch\n\nFurthermore, Vegas is a city, known for being “alive” at night. Another reason this song’s story, or the whole album takes place in Vegas are Abel’s\nrepeated references of it, adding to the fact, that he feels at home there.\n\nAbel fears, that he won’t be able to sleep, because he lost his loved one and needs to get her back to finally get sleep. At the end of his journey, he recalls this line. On “Final Lullaby”, the last track off the deluxe version of his album After Hours, Abel tries to accept the fact that he won’t find his love back in that night.\n\nI’m running out of time\nAnd you’ll always be on my mind\n\nAnother explanation could be his habit to be awake late at night, as already mentioned in “Alone Again”:\n\nI’m falling only for the night\n\nA possible reason for him being stressed during the day is his fame and popularity. During the day, Abel is blinded by the lights of police cars, but also by flashing camera lights, representing fame. Therefore, he likes to escape into the night, just like in his record “Snowchild”:\n\nLeaving, leaving into the night\nNow a nigga leaving, leaving\nLeaving into the night, oh']]), ('I’m going through withdrawals', [['A “withdrawal” can both mean the behavior in which one prefers to be alone or also the physical and mental effects experienced when a person stops using a drug. Considering Abel’s historic of drug abuse, which is largely mentioned in his songs, the second one is more likely.\n\nMoreover, in a 2016 interview with The Guardian he referred to the subject:\n\nWhen I had nothing to do but make music, it was very heavy. Drugs were a crutch for me.']]), ('So I hit the road in overdrive, baby, oh', [[""Here, Abel alludes to his habit of driving over the speed limit, which he has mentioned in several songs in the past, such as on “Heartless,”“ featured on his fourth studio album, After Hours:\n\nI’ve been dodgin' death in the six-speed\n\nAbel also admits his love for dangerous speeding on his September 2016 single “Starboy”\n\n100 on the dash get me close to God\n\n“Blinding Lights” was also originally teased in a German Mercedes-Benz commercial, where The Weeknd is shown driving an electric car while the song plays in the background.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C83VEu-yuYA""]]), ('I’ve been tryna call', [['The first line of this song represents Abel’s vulnerability. A theme explored throughout the rest of this song. On the song “Coming Down,” Abel expresses very similar feelings:\n\nPick up your phone\nThe party’s finished and I want you to know\nI’m all alone\n\nWithout drugs, Abel feels a sense of loneliness. This is perhaps Abel’s truest and most authentic self.']]), ('I said, ooh, I’m blinded by the lights\n No, I can’t sleep until I feel your touch\n I said, ooh, I’m drowning in the night\n Oh, when I’m like this, you’re the one I trust\n Hey, hey, hey', [['This song directly follows the outro of “Faith,” where The Weeknd speaks about being in the back of a police car presumably after an overdose:\n\nI ended up in the back of a flashing car\nWith the city shining on my face\nThe lights are blinding me again\n\nThe “lights” here not only represent the lights from the police car or the city but also the fame Abel’s enjoyed for his recording career. From stage lights to paparazzi camera flashes, he’s been “blinded” by many examples of a wealthy and successful life, and he doesn’t plan on stopping anytime soon. However, his celebrity life often overshadows his deep personal life. On his 2018 song “Privilege,” Abel discusses how many fans and media sources didn’t believe that he could have a real and genuine relationship with a partner because of his status in fame:\n\nThey said our love is just a game, I don’t care what they say\n\nNevertheless, his relationship seems to be real and sound, as he claims that it is the only thing that can keep him peacefully inserted in this lifestyle.\n\nAbel also uses a similar line on “Snowchild,” the fifth track from After Hours:\n\nLeaving, leaving into the night\nNow a nigga leaving, leaving\nLeaving into the night, oh']]), ('I’ve been on my own for long enough', [['Abel’s been on his own since around the age of 17 when he dropped out of high school and left home to never come back. This is referenced on many of his songs, like “Rolling Stone,” from his mixtape Thursday, where he said:\n\n‘Cause I’ve been on these streets way too long, too long, too long\nBaby, I’ve been on this too long\n\nHe’s also implying that he has been single for quite some time now and has forgotten how to love. From 2015 to 2019 Abel and model Bella Hadid had an on and off relationship, and after spending a few months apart, Abel seems to have lost his ability to love.\n\nTo add on, throughout After Hours, Abel plays with the idea of being “alone together” or simply “alone” on songs like “Save Your Tears”, “Faith,” and the opening track “Alone Again:”\n\n‘Cause I don’t know if I can be alone again\nI don’t know if I can be alone again']]), ('I look around and\n Sin City’s cold and empty (Oh)\n No one’s around to judge me (Oh)\n I can’t see clearly when you’re gone', [['Las Vegas is nicknamed “Sin City” due to the city’s overwhelming presence of crime, drugs, and sexual promiscuity—all important themes throughout The Weeknd’s career. He also explores hedonism on his August 2011 song “Heaven or Las Vegas.”\n\nAbel experienced emptiness and heartbreak when he was briefly separated from Bella Hadid in 2019. The two have since reunited and emotionally completed The Weeknd.\n\nAbel previously touched upon his need for Bella on his November 2019 single, “Heartless”:\n\nYou just came back in my life\nYou never gave up on me (Why don’t you?)\nI’ll never know what you see (Why won’t you?)\nI don’t do well when alone (Oh yeah)']]), ('I’m just calling back to let you know (Back to let you know)\n I could never say it on the phone (Say it on the phone)\n Will never let you go this time (Ooh)', [['This line is very similar to the song “Heartless,” released just days before this song. Here, Abel describes how his love for whom is presumed to be Bella Hadid is much stronger than he can say on the phone to her. This is different than the feelings Abel has shown in previous albums, with his typical themes usually revolving around never showing love towards anyone he is with and only using them for sex.']])]",-0.4434,-0.4434,0.3361,Happy

I think you could take it in the most literal sense possible, like I need you on my chest, chest to chest, even though I guess hearts are on the opposite sides.  On the flip side, I think the way I see heart to heart is like, “Why can’t we just chop this up? Why can’t we just talk about this? Why can’t we just open our hearts to each other and figure out what went wrong?” You know what I’m saying?  ‘Cause a lot of relationships kind of end in a dismal spot. With my last one, there was kind of confusion, like distance kind of separated us, but there was never a true closure period or a true sign off message, like “Okay, this is why it happened.” Luckily, me and G are very stark in the contrast. I’m like completely over my last person type, so you can tell based off of talking to him that he’s still got the linger period. He’s still in that phase. Granted, his relationship was much deeper and more involved than mine. Mine was more of a summer fling type. A lot more innocent. At the end of the day, I personally don’t see myself doing that anymore. I’m just like a total free bird at this point, I feel like. But yeah, I think there’s still things that’ll bring up this person in my head. I try never to creep on their pages or anything. That definitely helps. I think when you’re constantly like, “Oh, do they have a new man? Do I need to like flex with a new girl or something?” Then like try to combat them, it’s like, no. You start playing these weird mental games. I just had to distance myself.']]), ('She’s sleeping on your side, what can I do?', [['It’s like you don’t even want this girl to be sleeping on this side. You’ll wake up and be like, “Man, I wish this was just my person. Straight up.” There’s not much you can do in that sense, but you think in the time being that this is gonna help. Whatever you’re doing. I think everybody notices in time that the only thing that can heal it is time. None of these coping mechanisms will actually end up helping you get out of this spot that you’re in mentally.']]), ('I’m looking at her face but I’m seeing you', [['Jack J: So I feel like this line is really kind of like, from certain girls that I’ve talked to, like a girl’s worst nightmare, almost. Like knowing that that they might be rebound or something, or knowing that they might be a void filler. I definitely, post my last relationship, I definitely kind of when into a phase where I was trying to fill the void by either going out or maybe I’ll just have a one night stand over here. It just means nothing at the end of the day. You think, personally, that it’s gonna help you cope, but it always ends up backfiring. ‘Cause, like I said, I’m looking at her face, but I’m seeing you. Even having that significant other around, having that touch, having that person around, that makes you instantly think of that person that you just lost, you know what I’m saying?']]), ('Even if I tell myself I can\n I know that I’ll break (I’ll break) before I can bend, yeah', [['Even in my head, if I’m like, “Nah, I’ll be good.

Whatever.” Even if I tell myself I’m gonna get through this, I know that I’ll break before I can bend. Before I can adapt to the situation, the circumstances that I’m in, and really actually make it work for me, I know I’m gonna break. Because I’m gonna throw it on full fledge. I’m gonna drink as much as I can, I’m gonna go have as much fun as I can, and do all the stuff that I know I’ll regret. That’s pretty much the break.

Let’s just go to dinner and talk about it.” She was thrilled. I was like, “Damn. That’s really all I gotta do? Okay.” But then after that, it’s like, “Wait, but you already got me the teddy and roses. I want this.” And that’s fine, too. Whatever. I feel like those are material things, and that’s probably why the relationship is over. 'Cause that’s not how a relationship should work. Maybe sometimes. I don’t know. Time is probably the most valuable thing you can give in any relationship, not even just a sexual relationship, in a friendship. You gotta give someone else time.

Maybe you do, I don’t know, but it’s very rare that two ships would collide. The ocean covers 75% of the world. I feel like, “thoughts of you and me keep passing by,” that’s a very real line for me. I think of my ex all the time. Maybe that’s weird, maybe it’s not, but for me that’s just how it is.

You’re making no sense
‘Round and ‘round in circles like it’s hopeless
Sending and deleting your emotions when suits you best
Taking as you please
I'm just here wondering
Why would you wanna pick it up from our last goodbye?
Did you forget the words that you said last time?
I'm struggling with my pride ‘cause you're on my mind
Pretty much all the time
Should I let this slide?

[Chorus]
If you're over it, why’d you let me take you home?
If you’re over it, then why’d you stay until the morning?
Crossing all the lines you madе, it’s clear to me that you're not rеally over it
You're not helping me get over

You-u-u-u, you-u-u-u-u-u, over

[Verse 2]
Do you want me or want me not?
Seems to me like you’re just turning it on and off
Cut me loose instead of leaving me in the dark
It’s getting old, make up your mind
Yes or no, black and white, yea ‘cause
[Chorus]
If you're over it, why’d you let me take you home?
If you’re over it, then why’d you stay until the morning?
Crossing all the lines you made, it’s clear to me that you're not really over it
You're not helping me get over you

Why do I pick it up when you hit my phone? (Why’d you let me take you home?)
Always change your mind when you’re left alone (Why’d you stay until the morning?)

We’re not getting closer, told me it was over (yea)

Yeah, you!
Yeah, you!

[Verse 1]
I used to wanna be
Living like there's only me
But now I spend my time
Thinking 'bout a way to get you off my mind (Yeah, you!)
I used to be so tough
Never really gave enough
And then you caught my eye
Giving me the feeling of a lightning strike (Yeah, you!)

[Pre-Chorus]
Look at me now, I'm falling
I can't even talk, still stuttering
This ground I'm on, it keeps shaking
Oh-oh-oh, now!

Is somebody to you
All I wanna be, yeah all I ever wanna be, yeah, yeah

But every time I look at you I just don't care
'Cause all I wanna be, yeah all I ever wanna be, yeah, yeah
Is somebody to you (Yeah, you! Hahaha)
[Verse 2: Demi Lovato]
I used to run around
I didn't wanna settle down
But now I wake each day
Looking for a way that I can see your face (Yeah, you!)
I've got your photograph
But, baby, I need more than that
I need to know your lips
Nothing ever mattered to me more than this (Yeah, you!)

I can't even talk, still stuttering
This ground I'm on, it keeps shaking

Just to hear you say you love me again

People say we're caught up in temporary love
We don't know what we're doin', they say we're too young
But they don't know a thing about us

I'll wait forever, it's never too late

[Outro]","[('I wake up\n And I’m not so mad at Twitter now', [['The news can upset people. With people who use social media for their news, they often shift the blame to said social media platform. Twitter has a reputation for being a more heavily used social media platform for news. It is also one Jack goes back and forth on using, presumably for similar reasons. With 2020 being full of negative news-worthy events, Jack may have gotten either annoyed or depressed from waking up to these headlines. However, once promotion for the One Spectacular Night livestream concert and OK ORCHESTRA began, Jack made his return to Twitter.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/JackAJRbrothers/status/1339990303290384388\n\nThe band also makes a reference to the famous social media platform in “Burn the House Down.”\n\n…[S]hould I march with every stranger from Twitter to get shit done?\n\nWith Twitter’s heavy influence on the public, it has become a large platform for both promoting and suppressing political opinions. This has led to Twitter heavily moderating political tweets, more so than is normal. This may have come as a relief to Jack as most of Donald Trump’s tweets were flagged for similar reasons, and eventually led to a permanent ban on the former President’s account. With the band openly supporting Trump’s opposing candidate and the next President, Joe Biden, Jack’s use of Twitter may be starting to become more enjoyable than it has before.']]), ('[Outro]', [['As was previously done with “Bummerland,” “Way Less Sad” features a sort of morphing between instrumentation and vocals, a technique Ryan has been working on for years, namely during the quarantine months of COVID-19 while live shows were cancelled. During the One Spectacular Night livestream concert on December 26, 2020, the band hinted that there would be more of this style of production throughout OK ORCHESTRA.\n\nThe brotherly trio later accepted the fan-made-up word “instrumorphing” as the official term for this method of production on April 3, 2021.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/AJRBrothers/status/1378349578622279684']]), ('Well, I can’t fall asleep, and I’m losing my mind\n ’Cause it’s half-past three and my brain’s on fire\n I been counting sheep, but the sheep all died\n And I’m trying too hard, but I can’t not try\n Well, I can’t fall asleep, and I’m losing my mind\n ’Cause it’s half-past three and my brain’s on fire\n I been counting sheep, but the sheep all died\n And I’m not dead yet, so I guess I’ll be alright', [['The second snippet of “Way Less Sad” was tweeted on Valentine’s Day, 2020, just three days before the single was released.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/AJRBrothers/status/1361042854496378882\n\nIt features a play on the idiom “counting sheep,” which is where a person who is struggling to fall asleep thinks about counting sheep, hoping the monotonous action will cause them to eventually fall asleep.\n\nAs the band teased in a retweet, OK ORCHESTRA talks about several controversial topics, and “Way Less Sad” lives up to that claim with its topics of mental health, insomnia and overall lack of joy in life. There is also a direct reference to “Three-Thirty,” which talks about covering as many important topics in a promotional single as possible, insinuating that these important topics keep the brotherly trio up at night.\n\n\n\nThe clock that features the time of three-thirty is used as a prop in the music video as well as the backgrounds of both respective single artwork covers (1, 2) for “Bang!”']]), ('I’m a-okay, I’m a-okay', [['These lyrics were originally posted as a social media caption in the months leading up to the release of OK ORCHESTRA.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/AJRBrothers/status/1354881972229857282\n\nWith the post being made on January 28, 2021, the caption was later confirmed to be lyrics due to a snippet being released a week and a half later on February 7, which showed Jack filming a scene for the music video.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/AJRBrothers/status/1358505865968578560\n\nAs the song deals with the topic of mental health, Jack is telling himself and/or other people that he is okay despite knowing he is, in fact, not okay. While he is working toward an eventual state of joy in life, he is trying to tell himself to enjoy the current times of happiness while they last until he can achieve a better, more joyful state of mind in the future.']])]",-0.9997,-0.9997,0.38,Happy

But for the missile monsoon

Well, I’m not a kid anymore but, people being labeled as just migrants or just refugees or just immigrants, and really they’re human people just like everyone else, and we were thinking about particularly the young people who’ve been displaced, who just want to go home and be normal just like everybody else.']]), ('Tulips the colour of honey today', [['Tulips have long played a significant role in Middle Eastern culture, with the plant having originated from Persia – Iran’s state emblem resembles a tulip. The plant is also used prominently in Persian poetry, from the 13th century works of Saadi to the 20th and 21st century works of Simin Behbahani. Persian poetry previously served as inspiration for Coldplay’s seventh album, A Head Full of Dreams.\n\nWhile the significance of the tulips in this song is unclear, it is possible that the singer is simply describing the colours of the last batch of tulips that Rosaleem’s father sowed prior to their deaths – orange and yellow like honey.']]), ('Yes, she had eyes like the moon\n Would have been on the silver screen\n But for the missile monsoon', [['Rosaleem is described as having inherent beauty, so much so that it would have been possible for her to have lived to become a successful actress – the “silver screen” refers to the static screen at a cinema, where films are projected onto. Unfortunately this is not to be, as a monsoon of artillery is fired upon her residence without prejudice, killing her and her father.\n\nBy the end of December 2013, it had been estimated by the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) that around 46,226 civilians had been killed by combatants in the Syrian Civil War. The Syrian Network for Human Rights (SNHR) has since estimated the number to have risen to 224,948 by the end of September 2019. Thousands of innocent, talented people in Syria, like Rosaleem, simply never got the chance to live out their lives and make their contributions to the world, as a result of the ongoing fighting in the country.']]), ('Boom boom kah, buba de kah\n Boom boom kah, buba de kah\n Boom boom kah, buba de kah', [['This onomatopoeic percussion, which accompanies the drum kit percussion, mimics the sound of conventional bombs exploding – translating it into a rhythm. Explosive attacks in Damascus, Syria, where this song is set, were frequent throughout the early stages of the Syrian Civil War, and has so far caused nearly 10,000 casualties in the city.\n\nThe onomatopoeia was created by Chris Martin’s youngest son, Moses Martin, and is performed by him on the track. While it is most prominent in the song’s bookends, it can still be heard throughout the track’s verses and choruses. Moses is also credited as a co-writer on this song.']]), ('Cherubim, Seraphim soon\n Come sailing us home by the light of the moon', [['Cherub and Seraphim are a pair of arch-angels.

It showcases how the attack orchestrated by the US, UK, and France caused several casualties and displaced several people. It shows a girl named Rosaleem and her Baba (Persian for father) who are now refugees; they are labeled as Damascene which refers to someone who is an inhabitant of the city of Damascus.\n\n\n\n(Aftermath of the Damascus bombing, April 14, 2018)\n\nThe lines also comment on the inherent beauty of the city of Damascus and the Arabian culture, and how everything got lost after the war.']])]",0.9737,0.9737,0.3015,Happy

This imagery is powerful because it’s intimate: two lovers share a community and a life.']]), ('Lived in the shade you were throwing\n ’Til all of my sunshine was gone, gone, gone', [['Taylor uses a clever play on the word “shade”. “Throwing shade” is a slang term used to describe someone making negative comments about a person – generally in a sneaky, backhanded manner. This is not the first time she used the phrase to call out her haters – in “This Is Why We Can’t Have Nice Things” she sings:\n\nBut I’m not the only friend you’ve lost lately\nIf only you weren’t so shady\n\nTaylor plays on the literal interpretation of the word which is: “comparative darkness and coolness caused by shelter from direct sunlight”. As shade takes away sunlight, this line details how the negativity of the song’s subject(s) took away from her happiness and light in her life.\n\nThis concept of light and dark is a continuous theme throughout the album. reputation was characterized by darker themes – visually, sonically and lyrically. Lover contrasts this with themes of color, brightness and light.\n\nThematically this represents a shift in Taylor’s life from darkness (negativity) to sunshine/light (positivity). This was visually portrayed in the album’s debut music, “ME!”:']]), ('How many days did I spend thinking\n ’Bout how you did me wrong, wrong, wrong?', [['The subject of this song is never explicitly mentioned. Although this song may be addressing negativity, hate and drama Swift may have faced in a more general sense, there is nonetheless speculation about the subject of the song.\n\nAn obvious pick is rap artist, Kanye West, whom Taylor had a highly publicized on-again-off-again feud with since 2009, when he infamously interrupted her VMA Best Female Video acceptance speech. Much of her reputation album revolved around this feud. Her track “This Is Why We Can’t Have Nice Things”, for example, shows how she felt done wrong as she sings:\n\nIt was so nice being friends again\nThere I was, giving you a second chance\nBut you stabbed me in the back while shaking my hand\n\nMany fans, however, speculate that the song may be about ex-boyfriend Calvin Harris. He famously lashed out at Taylor on Twitter after their break-up. It’s interesting as there are no songs in Taylor’s discography known to be written about Calvin specifically, whereas Swift has penned tracks for most of her exes more explicitly. If the speculation is true, the song hits even harder as the only track penned about him is a track disregarding his importance in her life completely.']]), ('I forgot that you existed\n And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn’t\n And it was so nice\n So peaceful and quiet\n I forgot that you existed\n It isn’t love, it isn’t hate, it’s just indifference\n I forgot that you', [['Swift released her previous album, 2017’s reputation, after a spike in highly-publicized controversies. One example was a fallout with ex-boyfriend Calvin Harris, after word got out that she secretly co-wrote his hit “This Is What You Came For.” Some fans believe the reputation track “I Did Something Bad” took inspiration from this incident.\n\nPerhaps the most vicious feud Swift has been involved in was her long-standing conflict with Kanye West, which was reignited when West put derogatory, sexist lyrics about her on his track “Famous” and claimed that Swift gave permission for him to say such things about her. She later explained her side of the story in a 2019 Rolling Stone interview, and touched upon a desire for vengeance on 2017’s “Look What You Made Me Do”:\n\nThe world moves on, another day, another drama, drama\nBut not for me, not for me, all I think about is karma\n\nThis chorus sees Swift saying goodbye to the toll these situations took on her, which she detailed throughout reputation. The delivery of the song matches the lyrics, with the phrases in the chorus being spoken flatly rather than sung — this further emphasizes the true indifference and lack of worry Swift feels towards the song’s subjects.']]), ('Laughed on the school yard\n As soon as I tripped up and hit the ground, ground, ground', [['This line uses the school playground as a metaphor for being in the limelight, where people laugh at one’s mistakes. It is one of the multiple references to school on the album — she uses a similar metaphor on “Miss Americana and The Heartbreak Prince”:\n\nThey whisper in the hallway, ‘She’s a bad, bad girl’ The whole school is rolling fake dice\n\nAnd on the penultimate track, “It’s Nice to Have a Friend”:\n\nSchool bell rings, walk me home']]), ('But then something happened one magical night', [['This sentiment is particularly shady when one considers Swift’s history of using magical, fairytale-esque imagery to talk about the highlights of her relationships, with key examples being her 2010 track “Enchanted” and even Lover’s title track.\n\nSwift told Rolling Stone about the circumstances that allowed her to drop her past qualms in such a way:\n\nIt was sometime on the [2018] Reputation tour, which was the most transformative emotional experience of my career. That tour put me in the healthiest, most balanced place I’ve ever been. After that tour, bad stuff can happen to me, but it doesn’t level me anymore. […] Something about that tour made me disengage from some part of public perception I used to hang my entire identity on, which I now know is incredibly unhealthy.']]), ('Got out some popcorn\n As soon as my rep started going down, down, down', [['Swift thoroughly discussed the downfall of her public persona on her 2017 album reputation, on songs like “Delicate” and “Look What You Made Me Do.” To someone who didn’t listen to the full album, or want to hear Swift’s side of the story, the record’s singles made it look like the project focuses on her image, but Swift explained the symbolic meaning in a 2019 interview with Rolling Stone:\n\nThe one-two punch, bait-and-switch of Reputation is that it was actually a love story. It was a love story in amongst chaos. All the weaponized sort of metallic battle anthems were what was going on outside. That was the battle raging on that I could see from the windows.\n\nPopcorn is recognized as the default movie theater snack, and people often say something like “get out the popcorn” when they’re excited to watch drama unfold.']]), ('In my feelings more than Drake, so yeah', [['If someone is “in [their] feelings,” they’re emotional, often after being hurt by someone else. Drake brought this term to modern-day prominence with his June 2018 track “In My Feelings,” on which he questioned whether his feelings for several love interests were reciprocated.\n\nIf the song is truly about Kanye West, this lyric could reference Drake’s own feud with the rapper.

Did a full one-eighty, crazy
Thinking 'bout the way I was
Did the heartbreak change me? Maybe

I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary

Hurt me with the word ""goodbye""?

Dua moved on to date Paul Klein, who is a member of the indie-pop band LANY, before getting back together with Isaac in June 2018.

I'll keep it simple and try to explain
But it's harder to say than you think

Like, we all wanna win, but life ain't a game
So why we keep pushing
And driving ourselves 'til we're insane?

But that's what makes us glorious

So let's just make it glorious

Whenever I look in the mirror
And talk to my body and say
""It could be tighter""

When you called up my phone
I was all alone
Voice close to my ear
Like the sound of a song
You said ""Let's take a ride""
This was late July
We got lost in the night
(We got lost in the night)
So we drove around town
In your beat-up car
Soft sounds of your breath
And the sound of my heart

[Pre-Chorus]
Don’t remember the words
I know how I felt
Is this trouble again?

[Chorus]
I never felt like this with somebody
I never thought I'd feel like I do
I never felt this close with somebody
Somebody, somebody but you
I never had this rush in my body
I never thought I'd feel something new
I never felt this close with somebody
Somebody, somebody but you
[Verse 2]
Something ’bout you and the way we fit
Like the stars in the night
Heat of you on my skin
Hadn't know you for long, but it felt like years
From the second we met, I knew things would change
Everything would change
Everything would change

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't remember the words
I know how I felt
Is this trouble again?

[Chorus]
I never felt like this with somebody
I never thought I'd feel like I do

I had a dream that someday
I would just fly, fly away
And I always knew I couldn't stay
So I had a dream that I'd just fly away

[Verse 1]
I've been on my own for a minute
Is it only me out here?
Searching for the place to begin it
Is it me? Is it you? Is it fear?
Standing on the line I was given
People staring at me while I'm here
No one seems to think that I fit in
But I don't wanna be like them

[Pre-Chorus]
No, 'cause I don't wanna be like them
'Cause I know that I, know that I

I had a dream that someday
I would just fly, fly away

Woah, woah, I'd fly away
[Verse 2]
No one knew how low I was feeling
I was scared to reach for it all
Knowing I was herе for a reason
But I was scared that if I tried, I'd fall
So whеre do I go now that I'm in it?
I never thought it'd be like this
Dreaming all my life and I did it
Thought the grass is greener than it is

[Chorus]
'Cause I had a dream that someday
I would just fly, fly away
And I always knew I couldn't stay
So I had a dream that I'd just fly away, away, oh

Our love was strong as a lion
Soft as the cotton you lie in
Times we got hot like an iron
You and I
Our hearts had never been broken
We were so innocent darling
We used to talk 'til the morning
You and I

[Pre-Chorus]
We had that mixtape on every weekend
Had it repeating, had it repeating

[Chorus]
You were my September Song, summer lasted too long
Time moves so slowly when you’re only fifteen
You were my September Song, tell me where have you gone
Do you remember me? We were only fifteen
And I, I remember the chorus, they were singing it for us
You were my September song, tell me where have you gone
Do you remember me? We were only fifteen

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I think that I see your
Face in the strangest of places
Down on the underground station
Passing by
I get a mad sense of danger
Feel like my heart couldn't take it
'Cause if we met we'd be strangers
You and I

Still, I play that mixtape every weekend
Got it repeating, got it repeating

The term was used by the American youth brand Vans for promotional slogans since the 1970s. BTS stays on-brand by referencing a brand that is a staple to youth culture across the globe while maintaining the retro theme of the song.\n\n\n\nThe music video for the song features many odes to the King of Pop, Michael Jackson, through its choreography. Therefore, “off the wall” could also be a reference to the super-star’s seminal eponymous album and its title track.\n\nWith “Dynamite” being released at a high point in their career, BTS is able to gather a huge crowd with their unconventional ways.

This lyric is also an allusion to Bob Dylan’s hit June 1965 track, “Like a Rolling Stone”.\n\nKeeping in the theme of the song, “rolling stone” could also be an allusion to the iconic magazine, Rolling Stone, a monthly magazine that focuses on popular culture founded in the 1960s.\n\nThe lyric could also be alluding to the legendary English rock band The Rolling Stones, formed in London in 1962.']]), ('King Kong, kick the drum', [['King Kong is a film monster (Kaiju), resembling an enormous gorilla, that has appeared in various media since 1933.']]), ('Jump up to the top, LeBron', [[""LeBron James is one of the greatest basketball players of all time, partly due to his vertical leap—LeBron has a vertical jump of 40 inches, whereas an average NBA player can jump 28 inches.\n\nInterestingly, Suga is seen wearing a Tune Squad basketball jersey from the 1996 movie Space Jam in the music video—this loosely ties in with the LeBron reference, who is set to be the protagonist in the sequel, Space Jam: A New Legacy.\n\n\n\nSuga donning a vintage Tune Squad jersey.\n\n\n\n\nFurthermore, these lines can also be interpreted as a metaphor for BTS' success on the charts, as they’ve “jumped” from a rookie K-pop group to international superstars.""]])]",0.9946,0.9946,0.7569,Happy

At this moment, Lovato is really happy with her new and supportive team and group of friends around her. For many years the singer would only get a calorie-low watermelon cake for her birthday, but her new manager Scooter Braun changed that. He gave her a real birthday cake when she turned 27, she recalls:\n\n[I started] crying because I was finally eating cake with a manager that didn’t need anything from me and that loved me for who I am and supported my journey.']])]",0.9984,0.9984,0.733,Happy

Every day, Groundhog Day
Goin' through motions felt so fake
Not myself, not my best
Felt like I failed the test

A day that is constantly repeated can symbolize a monotonous cycle that Katy Perry wants to break. This usually occurs when someone is unhappy, the monotony and sadness she escapes from allow her to be thankful now and happy (‘now I got back that smile’).']]), ('But every tear has been a lesson', [['Katy is talking about her last record “Witness” journey that brought her a series of hatred with all her image after approach about totalitarian governments, sexism, vulnerability and female empowerment, and that caused her worst phase of clinical depression, commented by her in her last interviews.\n\nKaty had cut and platinum her hair, bringing a mature look that was not well regarded after all her career being consumed by her sexualization.\n\n\n\nThe eyes and tears were a great image at her last album, so she means that every song going in the wrong way of the charts and every judgment made her better.\n\n\n\nAt the Witness: The Tour’s end, she said on a instagram post revealing a new tattoo referencing the era: […] this journey has taught me many lessons with a few tears along the way BUT I am happy to report a sense of real resilience as we wrap.']]), ('Used to be dull, now I sparkle', [['Katy takes back what she sung in her 2017 track “Mind Maze,” suggesting that she has healed and moved on from her depression:\n\nI used to be so sparkling\nBut now it’s not so charming']]), ('Had a piece of humble pie', [['This line likely refers to Katy’s previous album, Witness, being widely considered a huge step back for the artist.
