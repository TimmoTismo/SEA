Similarly, it is a criticism of “throwing shade” in its slang meaning: subtly disrespecting someone.']]), ('’Cause the rest of you\n The best of you\n Honey, belongs to me', [['Now that the singer’s lover has given away her heart and soul to “charity,” all that is left of her is her body, which Hozier describes as belonging to the singer. Belonging, meaning while her heart and soul are the nurturers of the loving aspect of their relationship, her body nurtures the physical aspect. He also adds that “the rest” of her (her body), is “the best” of her, relaying that she is, by herself, not a great person of character or morals and doesn’t have a good heart.\n\nEdit: A comment suggests that the singer never specifies the gender of the lover he is singing about, while true, Hozier has referred to this character as a female in interviews. One of his goals for this song was to subvert the “she’s the one who needs saving” stereotype of female characters in love songs, thus creating this frightening, strong, and seemingly un-movable character.\nThis comment also says, “Bold of [you] to assume… that all a female person has is a heart, soul, and body.” Well if songs were required to list everything a female “has”, then it would kind of ruin music. The heart represents intentions and nature, and every person has a soul and body, and the brain is a part of the body.']]), ('When I first saw you\n The end was soon', [['This is the setting for the beginning of the romance that ensues over the rest of the song. Hozier describes that when the singer first notices his love interest, the end of the world had already begun, or was about to begin.']]), ('It must’ve caught a good look at you', [['Hozier has mentioned that the song is partly about “imagining the object of your affections as a really terrifying individual who has a real darkness to themselves, who would be completely unphased by the worst possible scenario”.\nThis line shows just how powerful and terrifying this person must be, if they are this unphased by the end of the world\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDbma9rhCjc\n\nPROPOSED SUGGESTION: This line is sort of ambiguous. It’s unclear what about her stopped the end . It could be that it was so intimidated, but equally I think it’s possible that it was simply in awe and captivated by her. As if she alone could redeem the world it was on its way to burn.']]), ('Ain’t it warming you, the world gone up in flames?\n Ain’t it the life you, your lighting of the blaze?', [['This relates to the welcomed warmth of chaos and darkness that the person who caused it feels. Like an addiction, the power of the fire is also what makes them feel alive and want to cause more disaster. That way, the lover associates the image of his loved one with the image of fire. For him, both are unraveling and extremely powerful.']]), ('Ain’t it a gentle sound, the rolling in the graves?\n Ain’t it like thunder under earth, the sound it makes?', [['The “rolling in the graves” seems to echo the Jewish vision of the arrival of the Messiah. When the Messiah arrives, the dead of the earth will roll underground to Israel, awaken to greet the Messiah, and then go back to being dead. There is some discussion about the details of this- for in-depth questions, ask a rabbi.']]), ('Ain’t it exciting you, the rumble where you lay?\n Ain’t you my baby, ain’t you my baby?', [['The setup not only builds suspense but also shows how the speaker’s lover enjoys the darkness of thousands of dead people underground.

If there are prophecies, they will be brought to nothing; if tongues, they will cease; if knowledge, it will be brought to nothing. For we know partially and we prophesy partially, but when the perfect comes, the partial will pass away. When I was a child, I used to talk as a child, think as a child, reason as a child; when I became a man, I put aside childish things. At present we see indistinctly, as in a mirror, but then face to face. At present I know partially; then I shall know fully, as I am fully known. So faith, hope charity remain, these three; but the greatest of these is charity.”  ~  1 Corinthians 13']]), ('Nothing fucks with my baby\n Nothing can get a look in on my baby\n Nothing fucks with my baby\n Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing', [['Hozier inverts the stereotype of the man protecting his love. In the face of the Second Coming, his love just enjoys the chaos.\n\n“But also I kind of just wanted to subvert idea of being in love with somebody and feeling like you have to protect somebody…as a dude, ‘Nothing can harm you. Et cetera. I’ll protect you!’ In this it’s not. It’s ‘You can’t be harmed.’ It’s nothing to do with me, this person is just genuinely terrifying.

Hozier grew up in Ireland whereby close to 21% of deaths involve cremation and pyre.\n\nThroughout his career, Hozier has mentioned fires in multiple occasions, most notably on “Arsonist’s Lullaby” where he describes his infatuation with fires:\n\nWhen I was a child, I’d sit for hours\nStaring into open flame\nSomething in it had a power\nCould barely tear my eyes away\n\nThe singer-songwriter has also described being set on fire during the filming of the music video for “Dinner & Diatribes” as “so much fun” in a tweet promoting the song.']])]",0.8865,0.8865,0.3697,Aroused

Who will love you?
Who will fight?
Who will fall far behind?","[('My my my, my my my, my my', [['“My my my” is something people say when they are surprised and disappointed and don’t know what else to say.\n\nOn another note, the repeating of “my” could be the singer stuttering through a broken voice. He is clearly hurt by how this is ending, and even though he knows it’s for the best, for both of them, it still hurts and he’s having trouble choking out the words.']]), ('Who will love you?\n Who will fight?\n Who will fall far behind?', [['This is the narrator starting back at square one. These could be general questions, or directed at the speaker or old lover. These questions about love could just be asking: who will be defeated by love? and who will fight until the end? and who will be the cause of that outcome?\n\nIt’s hard to determine if the “who” in this series of questions is directed internally or externally. If internally, Vernon may be splitting up his persona into the part that wants to fall into despair and the part that wants to fight for the relationship. If external, Vernon may be agonizing over what his current girlfriend’s future prospects look like.']]), ('Come on, skinny love, just last the year', [['The narrator knows the relationship isn’t in a healthy place, but he’s still praying that it will keep going, because he feels like he needs it.\n\nSkinny love refers to the idea of a malnourished or unhealthy relationship between two people.\n(As explained by Justin Vernon)\n\nIn an interview with Pitchfork, Vernon further says that such relationships are “skinny” in that they don’t “have weight.” This ties into the idea of malnourishment, but may also simply mean that the relationship is, in a very literal way, thin: physically insubstantial, tenuous, and fragile. Drawing upon Vernon’s comment that “you’re in a relationship because you need help, but that’s not necessarily why you should be in a relationship. And that’s skinny”, we could also see the word to mean unreal or illusionary—thin in the sense that it lacks those things which make lasting relationships. This would make sense of the second half of the line: wishing for a fading illusion to be maintained for a bit longer is a very sensical idea. In short: every possible meaning of “skinny” or “thin” seems correct here.']]), ('Staring at the sink of blood and crushed veneer', [['This is a metaphor for Vernon’s inability to enter his new relationship cleanly, since he can’t seem to clean up the mess from his previous engagement. One of the definitions for veneer is “a superficially valuable or pleasing appearance.” The veneer was destroyed, thus symbolizing a relationship that was built on something that was not real then it was destroyed.\n\nWood veneer is commonly used in wall paneling, so the idea of crushed veneer would suggest a damaged wall. The common image of a person punching a wall out of frustration would fit here, leading to washing the debris out of one’s wounded hand in a “sink of blood and crushed veneer.” Wood  veneer dresses up a house or a room to make it appear to have been built out of finer materials. When the veneer is crushed perhaps in a violent rage the truth is revealed.\n\nThis is an appropriate image for this moment in the song, after which the singer is silent for a bar or so; the hopelessness and helplessness felt by one whose frustration is so intense as to have them punching through a wall, unable to do anything but stand staring at the damage left in their wake – both literal and metaphorical – is well illustrated by the music continuing steadily under that vocal pause.']]), ('Right in this moment, this order’s tall', [['The narrator is too cowardly to end the relationship himself, though he is unable to nurture the relationship himself. The irony is that he yearns for a healthy relationship, without realizing the amount of selfless efforts that he actually has to put in. The speaker is aware that what is requested of the relationship will be very hard to fulfill, but the speaker wants this to happen at that very moment.\n\nA “tall order” is a something that is difficult. Vernon is saying ending the relationship himself is too difficult, or possibly that staying in the relationship is too difficult.']]), ('And I’ll be holding all the tickets\n And you’ll be owning all the fines', [['The narrator is still hung up on his pains emanating from his past relationship(s), of which he has not fully recovered from.\n\nTickets are used as a euphemism for the lack of honest love reciprocated by the narrator while being in the present relationship, while asking his lover for patience, finesse, balance and kindness.\n\nThe relationship didn’t last long enough for the narrator to correct his mistakes, leaving the lover with all the fines in the forms of wasted time, heartache and potentially perpetuating the venomous relationship of skinny loves onto others.\n\nWhen things finally get better In the morning, Vernon knows he will owe her big time for her staying with him through all this. He’s the one being given the tickets (think speeding ticket), she owns the fines, which means he acknowledges that he owes her.']]), ('Sullen load is full, so slow on the split', [['The sex is really good, though impersonal and emotionless. It is implied that the narrator is still lonely despite being in a sexually-gratifying relationship.\n\nThe speaker could be describing the load as sullen, meaning what is being carried is bad tempered, or gloomy. “Slow on the split” could mean the the lover took a long time to finally end the relationship, as the speaker had mentioned wanting the lover to end it earlier in the song.\n\nVernon is describing his current behavior as sullen, saying his “load is full” meaning he’s carrying so much baggage he doesn’t have room to help his current girlfriend, and that he is “so slow on the split,” meaning that his recovery from splitting up with his last girlfriend is slow.']]), ('Suckle on the hope in light brassieres', [['The skinny love relationship is based on lust, where both lovers are bound together only by their sexual attraction to each other.\n\nIt is implied that the relationship is not built with sufficient emphasis on emotional, intellectual and spiritual connections between them.\n\nSuckle is a verb, meaning: “feed (a baby or young animal) from the breast or teat.” with this being said, the speaker is referencing the hope that is felt when they have sex is what nourished the love, and the speaker might miss this, or not see why things had to end.\n\nVernon is anthropomorphizing “skinny love” in this line. She would have small breasts, requiring a light (small) brassiere. Even a skinny mother gives some milk to her child. Vernon is using this imagery to say that he sees things in his current relationship, as incomplete as it is, that make him think it can still work and give him hope.']]), ('Come on, skinny love, what happened here?', [['He is wondering how the two of them let things get to the point that they are at.\n\nThe speaker does not understand how things slipped away between them. The speaker may be disappointed in that it didn’t last, as expectations were set. These expectations were not met, and the speaker could blame the failure of the relationship on that.']]), ('And in the morning I’ll be with you\n But it will be a different kind', [['He is still there and the relationship continues but the feelings are not the same\n\nThis may reference the internal conflict with love that the speaker faces. At night, the speaker may want to end the relationship and feel very dark. but in the morning, it’s a new start, making it a vicious cycle. The speaker also recognizes that this love is a different kind because it is not pure or pursued with the best motives.\n\nThe relationship is built on sex of great passion and intimacy, which is not repeated outside of the bedroom.\n\nAfter explaining what he needs from her to help him heal, he uses In the morning as a metaphor for what will happen after he is done recovering from his dark period (the night). It in the second line refers to the relationship, It will be a different kind of relationship, presumably a better one.\n\n“A different kind” means they will be together in mourning, instead of just being together in the morning.']])]",0.9626,0.9626,0.1303,Aroused

The droll delight of deemsterhood, a win from the wood to bond. Like the bright lamps, Thamamahalla, yearin out yearin. Auspicably suspectable but in expectancy of respectable-ness. From dirty flock bedding, drip dropping through the ceil — ing, with two sisters of charities on the front steps and three eva — cuan cleansers at the back gaze, single box and pair of chairs (suspectable), occasionally and alternatively used by husband when having writing to do in connection with equitable druids and friendly or other societies through periods of dire want with comparative plenty (thunderburst, ravishment, dissolution and providentiality) to a sofa allbeit of hoarsehaar with Amodicum cloth, hired payono, still playing off, used by the youngsters for czurnying out oldstrums, three bedrooms upastairs, of which one with fireplace (aspectable), with greenhouse in prospect (par-ticularly perspectable).

Down.

Like Jukoleon, the seagoer, when he bore down in his perry boat he had raised a slide and shipped his orders and seized his pullets and primed their plumages, the fionnling and dubhlet, the dun and the fire, and, sending them one by other to fare fore fom, he had behold the residuance of a delugion: the foggy doze still going strong, the old thalassocrats of invinsible empores, maskers of the waterworld, facing one way to another way and this way on that way, from severalled their fourdimmansions. Where the lighning leaps from the numbulous; where coold by cawld breide lieth langwid; the bounds whereinbourne our solied bodies all attomed attaim arrest: appoint, that’s all. But see what follows. Wringlings upon wronglings among incomputables about an uncomeoutable (an angel prophetethis? kingcorrier of beheasts? the calif in his halifskin? that eyriewinging one?) and the voids bubbily vode’s dodos across the which the boomomouths from their dupest dupes were in envery and anononously blowing great.

Not to pad them behaunt in the fear. Not to go, tonnerwatter, and bungley well chute the rising gianerant. Not to wandly be woking around jerumsalemdo at small hours about the murketplots, smelling okey boney, this little figgy and arraky belloky this little pink into porker but, porkodirto, to let the gentlemen pedesta-rolies out of the Monabella culculpuration live his own left leave, cullebuone, by perperusual of the petpubblicities without inwoking his also’s between (sic) the arraky bone and (suc) the okey bellock. And not to not be always, hemmer and hummer, treeing unselves up with one exite but not to never be caving nicely, pre-cisely, quicely, rebustly, tendrolly, unremarkably, forsakenly, hal — tedly, reputedly, firstly, somewhatly, yesayenolly about the back excits. Never to weaken up in place of the broths. Never to vvol-lusslleepp in the pleece of the poots. And, allerthings, never to ate the sour deans if they weren’t having anysin on their consients. And, when in Zumschloss, to never, narks, cease till the finely ending was consummated by the completion of accomplishment.

And thus within the tavern’s secret booth The wisehight ones who sip the tested sooth Bestir them as the Just has bid to jab The punch of quaram on the mug of truth.

K.C. jowls, they’re sodden in the secret. K.C. jowls, they sure are wise. K.C. jowls, the justicestjobbers, for they’ll find another faller if their ruse won’t rise. Whooley the Whooper.

Judging from recent conversations among third-world intellectuals, there is now an obsessive return of the national situation itself, the name of the country that returns again and again like a gong, the collective attention to ""us"" and what we have to do and how we do it, to what we can't do and what we do better than this or that nationality, our unique characteristics, in short, to the level of the ""people."" This is not the way American intellectuals have been discussing ""America,"" and indeed one might feel that the whole matter is nothing but that old thing called ""nationalism,"" long since liquidated here and rightly so. Yet a certain nationalism is fundamental in the third world {and also in the most vital areas of the second world), thus making it legitimate to ask whether it is all that bad in the end.(1) Does in fact the message of some disabused and more experienced first-world wisdom (that of Europe even more than of the United States) consist in urging these nation states to outgrow it as fast as possible? The predictable reminders of Kampuchea and of Iraq and Iran do not really seem to me to settle anything or suggest by what these nationalisms might be replaced except perhaps some global American postmodernist culture.

Many arguments can be made for the importance and interest of non­ canonical forms of literature such as that of the third world (2), but one is peculiarly self-defeating because it borrows the weapons of the adversary: the strategy of trying to prove that these texts are as ""great"" as those of the canon itself. The object is then to show that, to take an example from another non-canonical form, Dashiell Hammett is really as great as Dostoyevsky, and therefore can be admitted. This is to attempt dutifully to wish away all traces of that ""pulp"" format which is constitutive of sub-genres, and it invites immediate failure insofar as any passionate reader of Dostoyevsky will know at once, after a few pages, that those kinds of satisfactions are not present. Nothing is to be gained by passing over in silence the radical difference of non-canonical texts. The third-world novel will not offer the satisfactions of Proust or Joyce; what is more damaging than that, perhaps, is its tendency to remind us of outmoded stages of our own first-world cultural development and to cause us to conclude that ""they are still writing novels like Dreiser or Sherwood Anderson.""

A case could be built on this kind of discouragement, with its deep existential commitment to a rhythm of modernist innovation if not fashion-changes; but it

66

would not be a moralizing-historicist one, rather, which challenges our imprisonment in the present of postmodernism and calls for a reinvention of the radical difference of our own cultural past and its now seemingly old-fashioned situations and novelties.

But I would rather argue all this a different way, at least for now (3), these reactions to third-world texts are at one and the same time perfectly natural, perfectly comprehensible, and terribly parochial. If the purpose of the canon is to restrict our aesthetic sympathies, to develop a range of rich and subtle perceptions which can be exercised only on the occasion of a small but choice body of texts, to discourage us from reading anything else or from reading those things in different ways, then it is humanly impoverishing. Indeed our want of sympathy for these often unmodern third-world texts is itself frequently but a disguise for some deeper fear of the affluent about the way people actually live in other parts of the world-a way of life that still has little in common with daily life in the American suburb. There is nothing particularly disgraceful in having lived a sheltered life, in never having had to confront the difficulties, the complications and the frustrations of urban living, but it is nothing to be particularly proud of either. Moreover, a limited experience of life normally does not make for a wide range of sympathies with very different kinds of people (I'm thinking of differences that range from gender and race all the way to those of social class and culture).

The way in which all this affects the reading process seems to be as follows: as western readers whose tastes (and much else) have been formed by our own modernisms, a popular or socially realistic third-world novel tends to come before us, not immediately, but as though already-read. We sense, between ourselves and this alien text, the presence of another reader, of the Other reader, for whom a narrative, which strikes us as conventional or naive, has a freshness of information and a social interest that we cannot share. The fear and the resistance I'm evoking has to do, then, with the sense of our own non-coincidence with that Other reader, so different from ourselves; our sense that to coincide in any adequate way with that Other ""ideal reader""--that is to say, to read this text adequately--we would have to give up a great deal that is individually precious to us and acknowledge an existence and a situation unfamiliar and therefore frightening--one that we do not know and prefer not to know.

Why, returning to the question of the canon, should we only read certain kinds of books? No one is suggesting we should not read those, but why should we not also read other ones? We are not, after all, being shipped to that ""desert island"" beloved of the devisers of great books lists. And as a matter of fact--and this is to me the conclusive nail in the argument--we all do ""read"" many different kinds of texts in this life of ours, since, whether we are willing to admit it or not, we spend much of our existence in the force field of a mass culture that is radically

67

different from our ""great books"" and live at least a double life in the various compartments of our unavoidably fragmented society. We need to be aware that we are even more fundamentally fragmented than that; rather than clinging to this particular mirage of the ""centered subject"" and the unified personal identity, we would do better to confront honestly the fact of fragmentation on a global scale; it is a confrontation with which we can here at least make a cultural beginning.

A final observation on my use of the term ""third world."" I take the point of criticisms of this expression, particularly those which stress the way in which it obliterates profound differences between a whole range of non-western countries and situations (indeed, one such fundamental opposition--between the traditions of the great eastern empires and those of the post-colonial African nation states­-is central in what follows). I don't, however, see any comparable expression that articulates, as this one does, the fundamental breaks between the capitalist first world, the socialist bloc of the second world, and a range of other countries which have suffered the experience of colonialism and imperialism. One can only deplore the ideological implications of oppositions such as that between ""developed"" and ""underdeveloped"" or ""developing"" countries; while the more recent conception of northern and southern tiers, which has a very different ideological content and import than the rhetoric of development, and is used by very different people, nonetheless implies an unquestioning acceptance of ""convergence theory""-- namely the idea that the Soviet Union and the United States are from this perspective largely the same thing. I am using the term ""third world"" in an essentially descriptive sense, and objections to it do not strike me as especially relevant to the argument I am making.

In these last years of the century, the old question of a properly world literature reasserts itself. This is due as much or more to the disintegration of our own conceptions of cultural study as to any very lucid awareness of the great outside world around us. We may therefore--as ""humanists""--acknowledge the pertinence of the critique of present-day humanities by our titular leader, William Bennett, without finding any great satisfaction in his embarrassing solution: yet another impoverished and ethnocentric Graeco-Judaic ""great books list of the civilization of the West,"" ""great texts, great minds, great ideas.""(4) One is tempted to turn back on Bennett himself the question he approvingly quotes from Maynard Mack: ""How long can a democratic nation afford to support a narcissistic minority so transfixed by its own image?"" Nevertheless, the present moment does offer a remarkable opportunity to rethink our humanities curriculum in a new way--to re-examine the shambles and ruins of all our older ""great books,"" ""humanities,"" ""freshman-introductory"" and ""core course"" type traditions.

Today the reinvention of cultural studies in the United States demands the reinvention, in a new situation, of what Goethe long ago theorized as ""world literature."" In our more immediate context, then, any conception of world literature necessarily demands some specific engagement with the question of third­world literature, and it is this not necessarily narrower subject about which I have something to say today.

It would be presumptuous to offer some general theory of what is often called third-world literature, given the enormous variety both of national cultures in the third world and of specific historical trajectories in each of those areas. All of this, then, is provisional and intended both to suggest specific perspectives for research and to convey a sense of the interest and value of these clearly neglected literatures for people formed by the values and stereotypes of a first-world culture. One important distinction would seem to impose itself at the outset, namely that none of these cultures can be conceived as anthropologically independent or autonomous, rather, they are all in various distinct ways locked in a life-and-death struggle with first-world cultural imperialism--a cultural struggle that is itself a reflection of the economic situation of such areas in their penetration by various stages of capital, or as it is sometimes euphemistically termed, of modernization. This, then, is some first sense in which a study of third-world culture necessarily entails a new view of ourselves, from the outside, insofar as we ourselves are (perhaps without fully knowing it) constitutive forces powerfully at work on the remains of older cultures in our general world capitalist system.

But if this is the case, the initial distinction that imposes itself has to do with the nature and development of older cultures at the moment of capitalist penetration, something it seems to me most enlightening to examine in terms of the marxian concept of modes of production.(5) Contemporary historians seem to be in the process of reaching a consensus on the specificity of feudalism as a form which, issuing from the break-up of the Roman Empire or the Japanese Shogunate, is able to develop directly into capitalism.(6) This is not the case with the other modes of production, which in some sense must be disaggregated or destroyed by violence, before capitalism is able to implant its specific forms and displace the older ones. In the gradual expansion of capitalism across the globe, then, our economic system confronts two very distinct modes of production that pose two very different types of social and cultural resistance to its influence. These are so-called primitive, or tribal society on the one hand, and the Asiatic mode of production, or the great bureaucratic imperial systems, on the other. African societies and cultures, as they became the object of systematic colonization in the 1880s, provide the most striking examples of the symbiosis of capital and tribal societies; while China and India offer the principal examples of another and quite different sort of engagement of capitalism with the great empires of the so-called

69

Asiatic mode. My examples below, then, will be primarily African and Chinese; however, the special case of Latin America must be noted in passing. Latin America offers yet a third kind of development--one involving an even earlier destruction of imperial systems now projected by collective memory back into the archaic or tribal. Thus the earlier nominal conquests of independence open them at once to a kind of indirect economic penetration and control--something Africa and Asia will come to experience only more recently with decolonization in the
1950s and 60s.

Having made these initial distinctions, let me now, by way of a sweeping hypothesis, try to say what all third-world cultural productions seem to have in common and what distinguishes them radically from analogous cultural forms in the first world. All third-world texts are necessarily, I want to argue, allegorical, and in a very specific way: they are to be read as what I will call national allegories, even when, or perhaps I should say, particularly when their forms develop out of predominantly western machineries of representation, such as the novel. Let me try to state this distinction in a grossly oversimplified way: one of the determinants of capitalist culture, that is, the culture of the western realist and modernist novel, is a radical split between the private and the public, between the poetic and the political, between what we have come to think of as the domain of sexuality and the unconscious and that of the public world of classes, of the economic, and of secular political power: in other words, Freud versus Marx. Our numerous theoretical attempts to overcome this great split only reconfirm its existence and its shaping power over our individual and collective lives. We have been trained in a deep cultural conviction that the lived experience of our private existences is somehow incommensurable with the abstractions of economic science and politi­ cal dynamics. Politics in our novels therefore is, according to Stendhal's canonical formulation, a ""pistol shot in the middle of a concert.""

I will argue that, although we may retain for convenience and for analysis such categories as the subjective and the public or political, the relations between them are wholly different in third-world culture. Third-world texts, even those which are seemingly private and invested with a properly libidinal dynamic­ necessarily project a political dimension in the form of national allegory: the story of the private individual destiny is always an allegory of the embattled situation of the public third-world culture and society. Need I add that it is precisely this very different ratio of the political to the personal which makes such texts alien to us at first approach, and consequently, resistant to our conventional western habits of reading?

I will offer, as something like the supreme example of this process of allegori­ zation, the first masterwork of China's greatest writer, Lu Xun, whose neglect in western cultural studies is a matter of shame which no excuses based on ignorance

70

can rectify. ""Diary of a Madman"" (1918) must at first be read by any western reader as the protocol of what our essentially psychological language terms a ""nervous breakdown."" It offers the notes and perceptions of a subject in intensify­ ing prey to a terrifying psychic delusion, the conviction that the people around him are concealing a dreadful secret, and that that secret can be none other than the increasingly obvious fact that they are cannibals. At the climax of the development of the delusion, which threatens his own physical safety and his very life itself as a potential victim, the narrator understands that his own brother is himself a cannibal and that the death of their little sister, a number of years earlier, far from being the result of childhood illness, as he had thought, was in reality a murder. As befits the protocol of a psychosis, these perceptions are objective ones, which can be rendered without any introspective machinery: the paranoid subject observes sinister glances around him in the real world, he overhears tell-tale conversations between his brother and an alleged physician (obviously in reality another cannibal) which carry all the conviction of the real, and can be objectively (or ""realistically"") represented. This is not the place to demonstrate in any detail the absolute pertinence, to Lu Xun's case history, of the pre-eminent western or first-world reading of such phenomena, namely Freud's interpretation of the paranoid delusions of Senatspräsident Schreber: an emptying of the world, a radical withdrawal of libido (what Schreber describes as ""world-catastrophe""), followed by the attempt to recathect by the obviously imperfect mechanisms of paranoia. ""The delusion-formation,"" Freud explains, ""which we take to be a pathological product, is in reality an attempt at recovery, a process of reconstruction.""(7)

What is reconstructed, however, is a grisly and terrifying objective real world beneath the appearances of our own world: an unveiling or deconcealment of the nightmarish reality of things, a stripping away of our conventional illusions or rationalizations about daily life and existence. It is a process comparable, as a literary effect, only to some of the processes of western modernism, and in particu­ lar of existentialism, in which narrative is employed as a powerful instrument for the experimental exploration of reality and illusion, an exploration which, how­ ever, unlike some of the older realisms, presupposes a certain prior ""personal knowledge."" The reader must, in other words, have had some analogous experience, whether in physical illness or psychic crisis, of a lived and balefully trans­ formed real world from which we cannot even mentally escape, for the full horror of Lu Xun's nightmare to be appreciated. Terms like ""depression"" deform such experience by psychologizing it and projecting it back into the pathological Other; while the analogous western literary approaches to this same experience--I'm thinking of the archetypal deathbed murmur of Kurtz, in Conrad's ""Heart of Darkness,"" ""The horror! the horror!""--recontains precisely that horror by transforming it into a rigorously private and subjective ""mood,"" which can only be
71

designated by recourse to an aesthetic of expression--the unspeakable, unnameable inner feeling, whose external formulation can only designate it from without, like a symptom.

But this representational power of Lu Xun's text cannot be appreciated prop­erly without some sense of what I have called its allegorical resonance. For it should be clear that the cannibalism literally apprehended by the sufferer in the attitudes and bearing of his family and neighbors is at one and the same time being attributed by Lu Xun himself to Chinese society as a whole: and if this attribution is to be called ""figural,"" it is indeed a figure more powerful and ""literal"" than the ""literal"" level of the text. Lu Xun's proposition is that the people of this great maimed and retarded, disintegrating China of the late and post-imperial period, his fellow citizens, are ""literally"" cannibals: in their desperation, disguised and indeed intensified by the most traditional forms and procedures of Chinese culture, they must devour one another ruthlessly to stay alive. This occurs at all levels of that exceedingly hierarchical society, from lumpens and peasants all the way to the most privileged elite positions in the mandarin bureaucracy. It is, I want to stress, a social and historical nightmare, a vision of the horror of life specifically grasped through History itself, whose consequences go far beyond the more local western realistic or naturalistic representation of cut-throat capitalist or market competition, and it exhibits a specifically political resonance absent from its natural or mythological western equivalent in the nightmare of Darwinian natural selection.

Now I want to offer four additional remarks about this text, which will touch, respectively, on the libidinal dimension of the story, on the structure of its allegory, on the role of the third-world cultural producer himself, and on the perspective of futurity projected by the tale's double resolution. I will be concerned, in dealing with all four of these topics, to stress the radical structural difference between the dynamics of third-world culture and those of the first-world cultural tradition in which we have ourselves been formed.

I have suggested that in third-world texts such as this story by Lu Xun the relationship between the libidinal and the political components of individual and social experience is radically different from what obtains in the west and what shapes our own cultural forms. Let me try to characterize this difference, or if you like this radical reversal, by way of the following generalization: in the west, conventionally, political commitment is recontained and psychologized or subjectivized by way of the public-private split I have already evoked. Interpretations, for example, of political movements of the 60s in terms of Oedipal revolts are familiar to everyone and need no further comment. That such interpretations are episodes in a much longer tradition, whereby political commitment is re-psychologized and accounted for in terms of the subjective dynamics of ressentiment or the authorita-

72

rian personality, is perhaps less well understood, but can be demonstrated by a careful reading of anti-political texts from Nietzsche and Conrad all the way to the latest cold-war propaganda.

What is relevant to our present context is not, however, the demonstration of that proposition, but rather of its inversion in third-world culture, where I want to suggest that psychology, or more specifically, libidinal investment, is to be read in primarily political and social terms. (It is, I hope, unnecessary to add that what follows is speculative and very much subject to correction by specialists: it is offered as a methodological example rather than a ""theory"" of Chinese culture.) We're told, for one thing, that the great ancient imperial cosmologies identify by analogy what we in the west analytically separate: thus, the classical sex manuals are at one with the texts that reveal the dynamics of political forces, the charts of the heavens at one with the logic of medical lore, and so forth.(8) Here already then, in an ancient past, western antinomies--and most particularly that between the subjective and the public or political--are refused in advance. The libidinal center of Lu Xun's text is, however, not sexuality, but rather the oral stage, the whole bodily question of eating, of ingestion, devoration, incorporation, from which such fundamental categories as the pure and the impure spring. We must now recall, not merely the extraordinary symbolic complexity of Chinese cuisine, but also the central role this art and practice occupies in Chinese culture as a whole. When we find that centrality confirmed by the observation that the very rich Chinese vocabulary for sexual matters is extraordinarily intertwined with the language of eating; and when we observe the multiple uses to which the verb ""to eat"" is put in ordinary Chinese language (one ""eats"" a fear or a fright, for example), we may feel in a somewhat better position to sense the enormous sensitivity of this libidinal region, and of Lu Xun's mobilization of it for the dramatization of an essentially social nightmare-something which in a western writer would be consigned to the realm of the merely private obsession, the vertical dimension of the personal trauma.

A different alimentary transgression can be observed throughout Lu Xun's works, but nowhere quite so strikingly as in his terrible little story, ""Medicine."" The story portrays a dying child--the death of children is a constant in these works--whose parents have the good fortune to procure an ""infallible"" remedy. At this point we must recall both that traditional Chinese medicine is not ""taken,"" as in the west, but ""eaten,"" and that for Lu Xun traditional Chinese medicine was the supreme locus of the unspeakable and exploitative charlatanry of traditional Chinese culture in general. In his crucially important Preface to the first collection of his stories,(9) he recounts the suffering and death of his own father from tuberculosis, while declining family reserves rapidly disappeared into the purchase of expensive and rare, exotic and ludicrous medicaments. We will not sense the

73

symbolic significance of this indignation unless we remember that for all these reasons Lu Xun decided to study western medicine in Japan--the epitome of some new western science that promised collective regeneration--only later to decide that the production of culture--I am tempted to say, the elaboration of a political culture--was a more effective form of political medicine.(10) As a writer, then, Lu Xun remains a diagnostician and a physician. Hence this terrible story, in which the cure for the male child, the father's only hope for survival in future generations, turns out to be one of those large doughy-white Chinese steamed rolls, soaked in the blood of a criminal who has just been executed. The child dies anyway, of course, but it is important to note that the hapless victim of a more properly state violence (the supposed criminal) was a political militant, whose grave is mysteriously covered in flowers by absent sympathizers of whom one knows nothing. In the analysis of a story like this, we must rethink our conventional conception of the symbolic levels of a narrative (where sexuality and politics might be in homology to each other, for instance) as a set of loops or circuits which intersect and overdetermine each other-the enormity of therapeutic cannibalism finally intersecting in a pauper's cemetery, with the more overt violence of family betrayal and political repression.

This new mapping process brings me to the cautionary remark I wanted to make about allegory itself-a form long discredited in the west and the specific target of the Romantic revolution of Wordsworth and Coleridge, yet a linguistic structure which also seems to be experiencing a remarkable reawakening of interest in contemporary literary theory. If allegory has once again become somehow congenial for us today, as over against the massive and monumental unifications of an older modernist symbolism or even realism itself, it is because the allegorical spirit is profoundly discontinuous, a matter of breaks and heterogeneities, of the multiple polysemia of the dream rather than the homogeneous representation of the symbol. Our traditional conception of allegory-based, for instance, on stereotypes of Bunyan, is that of an elaborate set of figures and personifications to be read against some one-to-one table of equivalences: this is, so to speak, a one-dimensional view of this signifying process, which might only be set in motion and complexified were we willing to entertain the more alarming notion that such equivalences are themselves in constant change and transformation at each perpetual present of the text.

Here too Lu Xun has some lessons for us. This writer of short stories and sketches, which never evolved into the novel form as such, produced at least one approach to the longer form, in a much lengthier series of anecdotes about a hapless coolie named Ah Q, who comes to serve, as we might have suspected, as the allegory of a certain set of Chinese attitudes and modes of behavior. It is interesting to note that the enlargement of the form determines a shift in tone or
74

generic discourse: now everything that had been stricken with the stillness and emptiness of death and suffering without hope-""the room was not only too silent, it was far too big as well, and the things in it were far too empty""(11) becomes material for a more properly Chaplinesque comedy. Ah Q's resiliency springs from an unusual-but we are to understand culturally very normal and familiar-technique for overcoming humiliation. When set upon by his persecutors, Ah Q, serene in his superiority over them, reflects: ""'It is as if I were beaten by my own son. What is the world coming to nowadays ...' Thereupon he too would walk away, satisfied at having won.""(12) Admit that you are not even human, they insist, that you are nothing but an animal! On the contrary, he tells them, I'm worse than an animal, I'm an insect! There, does that satisfy you?"" In less than ten seconds, however, Ah Q would walk away also satisfied that he had won, thinking that he was after all 'number one in self-belittlement,' and that after removing the 'self-belittlement' what remained was still the glory of remaining 'number one.""'(13). When one recalls the remarkable self-esteem of the Manchu dynasty in its final throes, and the serene contempt for foreign devils who had nothing but modern science, gunboats, armies, technology and power to their credit, one achieves a more precise sense of the historical and social topicality of Lu Xun's satire.

Ah Q is thus, allegorically, China itself. What I want to observe, however, what complicates the whole issue, is that his persecutors--the idlers and bullies who find their daily pleasures in getting a rise out of just such miserable victims as Ah Q--they too are China, in the allegorical sense. This very simple example, then, shows the capacity of allegory to generate a range of distinct meanings or messages, simultaneously, as the allegorical tenor and vehicle change places: Ah Q is China humiliated by the foreigners, a China so well versed in the spiritual techniques of self-justification that such humiliations are not even registered, let alone recalled. But the persecutors are also China, in a different sense, the terrible self-cannibalistic China of the ""Diary of a Madman,'' whose response to powerlessness is the senseless persecution of the weaker and more inferior members of the hierarchy.

All of which slowly brings us to the question of the writer himself in the third world, and to what must be called the function of the intellectual, it being under­ stood that in the third-world situation the intellectual is always in one way or another a political intellectual. No third-world lesson is more timely or more urgent for us today, among whom the very term ""intellectual"" has withered away, as though it were the name for an extinct species. Nowhere has the strangeness of this vacant position been brought home to me more strongly than on a recent trip to Cuba, when I had occasion to visit a remarkable college-preparatory school on the outskirts of Havana. It is a matter of some shame for an American to witness the cultural curriculum in a socialist setting which also very much identifies itself

75

with the third world. Over some three or four years, Cuban teenagers study poems of Homer, Dante's Inferno, the Spanish theatrical classics, the great realistic novels of the 19th-century European tradition, and finally contemporary Cuban revolutionary novels, of which, incidentally, we desperately need English translations. But the semester's work I found most challenging was one explicitly devoted to the study of the role of the intellectual as such: the cultural intellectual who is also a political militant, the intellectual who produces both poetry and praxis. The Cuban illustrations of this process--Ho Chi Minh and Augustino Nieto--are obviously enough culturally determined: our own equivalents would probably be the more familiar figures of DuBois and C.L.R. James, of Sartre and Neruda or Brecht, of Kollontai or Louise Michel. But as this whole talk aims implicitly at suggesting a new conception of the humanities in American education today, it is appropriate to add that the study of the role of the intellectual as such ought to be a key component in any such proposals.

I've already said something about Lu Xun's own conception of his vocation, and its extrapolation from the practice of medicine. But there is a great deal more to be said specifically about the Preface. Not only is it one of the fundamental documents for understanding the situation of the third world artist, it is also a dense text in its own right, fully as much a work of art as any of the greatest stories. And in Lu Xun's own work it is the supreme example of the very unusual ratio of subjective investment and a deliberately depersonalized objective narration. We have no time to do justice to those relationships, which would demand a line-by-line commentary. Yet I will quote the little fable by which Lu Xun, responding to requests for publication by his friends and future collaborators, dramatizes his dilemma:Imagine an iron house without windows, absolutely indestructible, with many people fast sleep inside who will shortly die of suffocation. But you know that since they will die in their sleep, they will not feel the pain of death. Now if you cry aloud to wake a few of the lighter sleepers, making those unfortunate few suffer the agony of irrevocable death, do you think you are doing them a good turn? (14)The seemingly hopeless situation of the third-world intellectual in this historical period (shortly after the founding of the Chinese Communist Party, but also after the bankruptcy of the middle-class revolution had become apparent)--in which no solutions, no forms of praxis or change, seem conceivable-this situation will find its parallel, as we shall see shortly, in the situation of African intellectuals after the achievement of independence, when once again no political solutions seem present or visible on the historical horizon. The formal or literary manifestation of

76

this political problem is the possibility of narrative closure, something we will return to more specifically.

In a more general theoretical context--and it is this theoretical form of the problem I should now like at least to thematize and set in place on the agenda--we must recover a sense of what ""cultural revolution"" means, in its strongest form, in the marxist tradition. The reference is not to the immediate events of that violent and tumultuous interruption of the ""eleven years"" in recent Chinese history, al­ though some reference to Maoism as a doctrine is necessarily implicit. The term, we are told, was Lenin's own, and in that form explicitly designated the literacy campaign and the new problems of universal scholarity and education: something of which Cuba, again, remains the most stunning and successful example in recent history. We must, however, enlarge the conception still further, to include a range of seemingly very different preoccupations, of which the names of Gramsci and Wilhelm Reich, Frantz Fanon, Herbert Marcuse, Rudolph Bahro, and Paolo Freire, may give an indication of their scope and focus. Overhastily, I will suggest that ""cultural revolution"" as it is projected in such works turns on the phenomenon of what Gramsci called ""subalternity,"" namely the feelings of mental inferiority and habits of subservience and obedience which necessarily and structurally develop in situations of domination-most dramatically in the experience of colonized peoples. But here, as so often, the subjectivizing and psychologizing habits of first-world peoples such as ourselves can play us false and lead us into misunderstandings. Subalternity is not in that sense a psychological matter, although it governs psychologies; and I suppose that the strategic choice of the term ""cultural"" aims precisely at restructuring that view of the problem and projecting it outwards into the realm of objective or collective spirit in some non-psychological, but also non-reductionist or non-economistic, materialistic fashion. When a psychic structure is objectively determined by economic and political relation­ ships, it cannot be dealt with by means of purely psychological therapies; yet it equally cannot be dealt with by means of purely objective transformations of the economic and political situation itself, since the habits remain and exercise a baleful and crippling residual effect.(15) This is a more dramatic form of that old mystery, the unity of theory and practice; and it is specifically in the context of this problem of cultural revolution (now so strange and alien to us) that the achievements and failures of third-world intellectuals, writers and artists must be replaced if their concrete historical meaning is to be grasped. We have allowed ourselves, as first-world cultural intellectuals, to restrict our consciousness of our life's work to the narrowest professional or bureaucratic terms, thereby encouraging in ourselves a special sense of subalternity and guilt, which only reinforces the vicious circle. That a literary article could be a political act, with real consequences, is for most of us little more than a curiosity of the literary history of Czarist

77

Russia or of modern China itself. But we perhaps should also consider the possibility that as intellectuals we ourselves are at present soundly sleeping in that indestructable iron room, of which Lu Xun spoke, on the point of suffocation.

The matter of narrative closure, then, and of the relationship of a narrative text to futurity and to some collective project yet to come, is not, merely a formal or literary-critical issue. ""Diary of a Madman"" has in fact two distinct and incom­ patible endings, which prove instructive to examine in light of the writer's own hesitations and anxieties about his social role. One ending, that of the deluded subject himself, is very much a call to the future, in the impossible situation of a well-nigh universal cannibalism: the last desperate lines launched into the void are the words, ""Save the children.. ."" But the tale has a second ending as well, which is disclosed on the opening page, when the older (supposedly cannibalistic) brother greets the narrator with the following cheerful remark: ""I appreciate your coming such a long way to see us, but my brother recovered some time ago and has gone elsewhere to take up an official post."" So, in advance, the nightmare is annulled; the paranoid visionary, his brief and terrible glimpse of the grisly reality beneath the appearance now vouchsafed, gratefully returns to the realm of illusion and oblivion therein again to take up his place in the space of bureaucratic power and privilege. I want to suggest that it is only at this price, by way of a complex play of simultaneous and antithetical messages, that the narrative text is able to open up a concrete perspective on the real future.

* * *

I must interrupt myself here to interpolate several observations before proceeding. For one thing, it is clear to me that any articulation of radical difference-that of gender, incidentally, fully as much as that of culture, is susceptible to appropriation by that strategy of otherness which Edward Said, in the context of the Middle East, called ""orientalism."" It does not matter much that the radical otherness of the culture in question is praised or valorized positively, as in the preceding pages: the essential operation is that of differentiation, and once that has been accomplished, the mechanism Said denounces has been set in place. On the other hand, I don't see how a first-world intellectual can avoid this operation without falling back into some general liberal and humanistic universalism: it seems to me that one of our basic political tasks lies precisely in the ceaseless effort to remind the American public of the radical difference of other national situations.

But at this point one should insert a cautionary reminder about the dangers of the concept of ""culture"" itself: the very speculative remarks I have allowed myself to make about Chinese ""culture"" will not be complete unless I add that ""culture"" in this sense is by no means the final term at which one stops. One must imagine

78

such cultural structures and attitudes as having been themselves, in the beginning, vital responses to infrastructural realities (economic and geographic, for example), as attempts to resolve more fundamental contradictions--attempts which then outlive the situations for which they were devised, and survive, in reified forms, as ""cultural patterns."" Those patterns themselves then become part of the objective situation confronted by later generations, and, as in the case of Confucianism, having once been part of the solution to a dilemma, then become part of the new problem.

Nor can I feel that the concept of cultural ""identity"" or even national ""iden­tity"" is adequate. One cannot acknowledge the justice of the general poststructuralist assault on the so-called ""centered subject,"" the old unified ego of bourgeois individualism, and then resuscitate this same ideological mirage of psychic unification on the collective level in the form of a doctrine of collective identity. Appeals to collective identity need to be evaluated from a historical perspective, rather than from the standpoint of some dogmatic and placeless ""ideological analysis."" When a third-world writer invokes this (to us) ideological value, we need to examine the concrete historical situation closely in order to determine the political consequences of the strategic use of this concept. Lu Xun's moment, for example, is very clearly one in which a critique of Chinese ""culture"" and ""cultural identity"" has powerful and revolutionary consequences­ consequences which may not obtain in a later social configuration. This is then, perhaps, another and more complicated way of raising the issue of ""nationalism"" to which I referred earlier.

As far as national allegory is concerned, I think it may be appropriate to stress its presence in what is generally considered western literature in order to under­ score certain structural differences. The example I have in mind is the work of Benito Perez Galdos--the last and among the richest achievements of 19th century realism. Galdos' novels are more visibly allegorical (in the national sense) than most of their better-known European predecessors (16): something that might well be explained in terms of Immanuel Wallerstein's world-system terminology.(17) Although 19th century Spain is not strictly peripheral after the fashion of the countries we are here designating under the term third world, it is certainly semi­peripheral in his sense, when contrasted with England or France. It is therefore not terribly surprising to find the situation of the male protagonist of Fortunata y Jacinta (1887)--alternating between the two women of the title, between the wife and the mistress, between the woman of the upper-middle classes and the woman of the ""people""--characterized in terms of the nation-state itself, hesitating between the republican revolution of 1868 and the Bourbon restoration of 1873.(18) Here too, the same ""floating"" or transferable structure of allegorical reference detected in Ah Q comes into play: for Fortunata is also married, and the alterna-

79

tion of ""revolution"" and ""restoration"" is likewise adapted to her situation, as she leaves her legal home to seek her lover and then returns to it in abandonment.

What it is important to stress is not merely the wit of the analogy as Galdos uses it, but also its optional nature: we can use it to convert the entire situation of the novel into an allegorical commentary on the destiny of Spain, but we are also free to reverse its priorities and to read the political analogy as metaphorical decoration for the individual drama, and as a mere figural intensification of this last. Here, far from dramatizing the identity of the political and the individual or psychic, the allegorical structure tends essentially to separate these levels in some absolute way. We cannot feel its force unless we are convinced of the radical difference between politics and the libidinal: so that its operation reconfirms (rather than annuls) that split between public and private which was attributed to western civilization earlier in our discussion. In one of the more powerful contemporary denunciations of this split and this habit, Deleuze and Guattari argue for a conception of desire that is at once social and individual.How does a delirium begin? Perhaps the cinema is able to capture the movement of madness, precisely because it is not analytical or regressive, but explores a global field of coexistence. Witness a film by Nicholas Ray, supposedly represent­ ing the formation of a cortisone delirium: an overworked father, a high-school teacher who works overtime for a radio-taxi service and is being treated for heart trouble. He begins to rave about the educational system in general, the need to restore a pure race, the salvation of the social and moral order, then he passes to religion, the timeliness of a return to the Bible, Abraham. But what in fact did Abraham do? Well now, he killed or wanted to kill his son, and perhaps God's only error lies in having stayed his hand. But doesn't this man, the film's protagonist, have a son of his own? Hmmm. ... What the film shows so well, to the shame of psychiatrists, is that every delirium is first of all the investment of a field that is social, economic, political cultural, racial and racist, pedagogical, and religious: the delirious person applies a delirium to his family and his son that overreaches them on all sides. (19)I am not myself sure that the objective consequences of this essentially social and concrete gap, in first-world experience, between the public and the private can be abolished by intellectual diagnosis or by some more adequate theory of their deeper interrelationship. Rather, it seems to me that what Deleuze and Guattari are proposing here is a new and more adequate allegorical reading of this film. Such allegorical structures, then, are not so much absent from first-world cultural texts as they are unconscious, and therefore they must be deciphered by interpretive mechanisms that necessarily entail a whole social and historical critique of our current first-world situation. The point here is that, in distinction to the uncon-

80

scious allegories of our own cultural texts, third-world national allegories are conscious and overt: they imply a radically different and objective relationship of politics to libidinal dynamics.

Now, before turning to the African texts, I remind you of the very special occasion of the present talk, which is concerned to honor the memory of Robert C. Elliott and to commemorate his life's work. I take it that the very center of his two most important books, The Power of Satire and The Shape of Utopia,(20) is to be found in his path breaking association of satire and the utopian impulse as two seemingly antithetical drives (and literary discourses), which in reality replicate each other such that each is always secretly active within the other's sphere of influence. All satire, he taught us, necessarily carries a utopian frame of reference within itself; all utopias, no matter how serene or disembodied, are driven secretly by the satirist's rage at a fallen reality. When I spoke of futurity a moment ago, I took pains to withhold the world ""utopia,"" which in my language is another word for the socialist project.

But now I will be more explicit and take as my motto an astonishing passage from the novel Xala, by the great contemporary Senegalese novelist and film­ maker Ousmane Sembene. The title designates a ritual curse or affliction, of a very special kind, which has been visited on a prosperous and corrupt Senegalese businessman at the moment in which, at the height of his fortune, he takes to himself a beautiful young (third) wife. Shades of The Power of Satire!, the curse is of course, as you may have guessed, sexual impotence. The Hadj, the unfortunate hero of this novel, desperately explores a number of remedies, both western and tribal, to no avail, and is finally persuaded to undertake a laborious trip into the hinterland of Dakar to seek out a shaman of reputedly extraordinary powers. Here is the conclusion of his hot and dusty journey in a horse-drawn cart:As they emerged from a ravine, they saw conical thatched roofs, grey-black with weathering, standing out against the horizon in the middle of the empty plain. Free-ranging, skinny cattle with dangerous-looking horns fenced with one another to get at what little grass there was. No more than silhouettes in the distance, a few people were busy around the only well. The driver of the cart was in familiar territory and greeted people as they passed. Sereen Mada's house, apart from its imposing size, was identical in construction with all the others. It was situated in the center of the village whose huts were arranged in a semi-circle, which you entered by a single main entrance. The village had neither shop nor school nor dispensary; there was nothing at all attractive about it in fact [Gusmane concludes, then he adds, as if in afterthought, this searing line:] There was nothing at all attractive about it in fact. Its life was based on the principles of community interdependence. (21)81

Here, then, more emblematically than virtually any other text I know, the space of a past and future utopia--a social world of collective cooperation-is dramatically inserted into the corrupt and westernized money economy of the new post­ independence national or comprador bourgeoisie. Indeed, Ousmane takes pains to show us that the Hadj is not an industrialist, that his business is in no sense productive, but functions as a middle-man between European multinationals and local extraction industries. To this biographical sketch must be added a very significant fact: that in his youth, the Hadj was political, and spent some time in jail for his nationalist and pro-independence activities. The extraordinary satire of these corrupt classes (which Ousmane will extend to the person of Senghor him­ self in The Last of the Empire) is explicitly marked as the failure of the independence movement to develop into a general social revolution.

The fact of nominal national independence, in Latin America in the 19th century, in Africa in the mid-20th, puts an end to a movement for which genuine national autonomy was the only conceivable goal. Nor is this symbolic myopia the only problem: the African states also had to face the crippling effects of what Fanon prophetically warned them against--to receive independence is not the same as to take it, since it is in the revolutionary struggle itself that new social relationships and a new consciousness is developed. Here again the history of Cuba is instructive: Cuba was the last of the Latin American nations to win its freedom in the 19th century--a freedom which would immediately be taken in charge by another greater colonial power. We now know the incalculable role played in the Cuban Revolution of 1959 by the protracted guerrilla struggles of the late 19th century (of which the figure of Jose Martf is the emblem); contemporary Cuba would not be the same without that laborious and subterranean, one wants to say Thompsonian, experience of the mole of History burrowing through a lengthy past and creating its specific traditions in the process.

So it is that after the poisoned gift of independence, radical African writers like Ousmane, or like Ngugi in Kenya, find themselves back in the dilemma of Lu Xun, bearing a passion for change and social regeneration which has not yet found its agents. I hope it is clear that this is also very much an aesthetic dilemma, a crisis of representation: it was not difficult to identify an adversary who spoke another language and wore the visible trappings of colonial occupation. When those are replaced by your own people, the connections to external controlling forces are much more difficult to represent. The newer leaders may of course throw off their masks and reveal the person of the Dictator, whether in its older individual or newer military form: but this moment also determines problems of representation. The dictator novel has become a virtual genre of Latin American literature, and such works are marked above all by a profound and uneasy ambivalence, a deeper ultimate sympathy for the Dictator, which can perhaps only be properly accounted

82

for by some enlarged social variant of the Freudian mechanism of transference.(22)

The form normally taken by a radical diagnosis of the failures of contemporary third-world societies is, however, what is conventionally designated as ""cultural imperialism,"" a faceless influence without representable agents, whose literary expression seems to demand the invention of new forms: Manuel Puig's Betrayed by Rita Hayworth may be cited as one of the most striking and innovative of those. One is led to conclude that under these circumstances traditional realism is less effective than the satiric fable: whence to my mind the greater power of certain of Ousmane's narratives (besides Xala, we should mention The Money-Order) as over against Ngugi's impressive but problematical Petals of Blood.

With the fable, however, we are clearly back into the whole question of allegory. The Money-Order mobilizes the traditional Catch-22 dilemma--its hapless protagonist cannot cash his Parisian check without identity papers, but since he was born long before independence there are no documents, and meanwhile the money-order, uncashed, begins to melt away before an accumulation of new credits and new debts. I am tempted to suggest, anachronistically, that this work, published in 1965, prophetically dramatizes the greatest misfortune that can happen to a third-world country in our time, namely the discovery of vast amounts of oil resources-something which as economists have shown us, far from representing salvation, at once sinks them incalculably into foreign debts they can never dream of liquidating.

On another level, however, this tale raises the issue of what must finally be one of the key problems in any analysis of Ousmane's work, namely the ambiguous role played in it by archaic or tribal elements. Viewers may perhaps remember the curious ending of his first film, The Black Girl, in which the European employer is inconclusively pursued by the little boy wearing an archaic mask; meanwhile such historical films as Ceddo or Emitai seem intent on evoking older moments of tribal resistance either to Islam or to the west, yet in a historical perspective which with few exceptions is that of failure and ultimate defeat. Ousmane cannot, however, be suspected of any archaizing or nostalgic cultural nationalism. Thus it becomes important to determine the significance of this appeal to older tribal values, particularly as they are more subtly active in modern works like Xala or The Money-Order.

I suspect that the deeper subject of this second novel is not so much the evident one of the denunciation of a modern national bureaucracy, but rather the historical transformation of the traditional Islamic value of alms-giving in a contemporary money economy. A Muslim has the duty to give alms-indeed, the work concludes with just such another unfulfilled request. Yet in a modern economy, this sacred duty to the poor is transformed into a frenzied assault by free-loaders from all the levels of society (at length, the cash is appropriated by a

83

westernized and affluent, influential cousin). The hero is literally picked clean by the vultures; better still, the unsought for, unexpected treasure fallen from heaven at once transforms the entire society around him into ferocious and insatiable petitioners, in something like a monetary version of Lu Xun's cannibalism.

The same double historical perspective--archaic customs radically trans­formed and denatured by the superposition of capitalist relations--seems to me demonstrable in Xala as well, in the often hilarious results of the more ancient Islamic and tribal institution of polygamy. This is what Ousmane has to say about that institution (it being understood that authorial intervention, no longer tolerable in realistic narrative, is still perfectly suitable to the allegorical fable as a form):It is worth knowing something about the life led by urban polygamists. It could be called geographical polygamy, as opposed to rural polygamy, where all the wives and children live together in the same compound. In the town, since the families a re scattered, the children have little contact with their father. Because of his way of life the father must go from house to house, villa to villa, and is only there in the evenings, at bedtime. He is therefore primarily a source of finance, when he has work. (23)Indeed, we are treated to the vivid spectacle of the Hadj's misery when, at the moment of his third marriage, which should secure his social status, he realizes he has no real home of his own and is condemned to shuttle from one wife's villa to the other, in a situation in which he suspects each of them in turn as being responsible for his ritual affliction. But the passage I have just read shows that­-whatever one would wish to think about polygamy in and of itself as an institution--it functions here as a twin-valenced element designed to open up historical perspective. The more and more frenzied trips of the Hadj through the great city secure a juxtaposition between capitalism and the older collective tribal form of social life.

These are not as yet, however, the most remarkable feature of Xala, which can be described as a stunning and controlled, virtually text-book exercise in what I have elsewhere called ""generic discontinuities.""(24) The novel begins, in effect, in one generic convention, in terms of which the Hadj is read as a comic victim. Everything goes wrong all at once, and the news of his disability suddenly triggers a greater misfortune: his numerous debtors begin to descend on someone whose bad luck clearly marks him out as a loser. A comic pity and terror accompanies this process, though it does not imply any great sympathy for the personage. Indeed it conveys a greater revulsion against the privileged new westernized society in which this rapid overturning of the wheel of fortune can take place. Yet we have all been in error, as it turns out: the wives have not been the source of the ritual

84

curse. In an abrupt generic reversal and enlargement (comparable to some of the mechanisms Freud describes in ""The Uncanny""), we suddenly learn something new and chilling about the Hadj's past:""Out story goes back a long way. It was shortly before your marriage to that woman there. Don't you remember? I was sure you would not. What I am now"" (a beggar in rags is addressing him) ""what I am now is your fault. Do you remember selling a large piece of land at Jeko belonging to our clan? After falsifying the clan names with the complicity of people in high places, you took our land from us. In spite of our protests, our proof of ownership, we lost our case in the courts. Not satisfied with taking our land you had me thrown into prison."" (25)Thus the primordial crime of capitalism is exposed: not so much wage labor as such, or the ravages of the money form, or the remorseless and impersonal rhythms of the market, but rather this primal displacement of the older forms of collective life from a land now seized and privatized. It is the oldest of modern tragedies, visited on the Native Americans yesterday, on the Palestinians today, and significantly reintroduced by Ousmane into his film version of The Money­ Order (called Mandabi), in which the protagonist is now threatened with the imminent loss of his dwelling itself.

The point I want to make about this terrible ""return of the repressed,"" is that it determines a remarkable generic transformation of the narrative: suddenly we are no longer in satire, but in ritual. The beggars and the lumpens, led by Sereen Mada himself, descend on the Hadj and require him to submit, for the removal of his xala, to an abominable ceremony of ritual humiliation and abasement. The representational space of the narrative is lifted to a new generic realm, which reaches back to touch the powers of the archaic even as it foretells the utopian destruction of the fallen present in the mode of prophecy. The word ""Brechtian,"" which inevitably springs to mind, probably does inadequate justice to these new forms which have emerged from a properly third-world reality. Yet in light of this unexpected generic ending, the preceding satiric text is itself retroactively transformed. From a satire whose subject-matter or content was the ritual curse visited on a character within the narrative, it suddenly becomes revealed as a ritual curse in its own right-the entire imagined chain of events becomes Ousmane's own curse upon his hero and people like him. No more stunning confirmation could be adduced for Robert C. Elliott's great insight into the anthropological origins of satiric discourse in real acts of shamanistic malediction.

I want to conclude with a few thoughts on why all this should be so and on the origins and status of what I have identified as the primacy of national allegory in third-world culture. We are, after all, familiar with the mechanisms of auto-

85

referentiality in contemporary western literature: is this not simply to be taken as another form of that, in a structurally distinct social and cultural context? Perhaps. But in that case our priorities must be reversed for proper understanding of this mechanism. Consider the disrepute of social allegory in our culture and the well-nigh inescapable operation of social allegory in the west's Other. These two contrasting realities are to be grasped, I think, in terms of situational conscious­-ness, an expression I prefer to the more common term materialism. Hegel's old analysis of the Master-Slave relationship (26) may still be the most effective way of dramatizing this distinction between two cultural logics. Two equals struggle each for recognition by the other: the one is willing to sacrifice life for this supreme value. The other, a heroic coward in the Brechtian, Schweykian sense of loving the body and the material world too well, gives in, in order to continue life. The Master--now the fulfillment of a baleful and inhuman feudal-aristocratic disdain for life without honor--proceeds to enjoy the benefits of his recognition by the other, now become his humble serf or slave. But at this point two distinct and dialectically ironic reversals take place: only the Master is now genuinely human, so that ""recognition"" by this henceforth sub-human form of life which is the slave evaporates at the moment of its attainment and offers no genuine satisfaction. ""The truth of the Master,"" Hegel observes grimly, ""is the Slave; while the truth of the Slave, on the other hand, is the Master."" But a second reversal is in process as well: for the slave is called upon to labor for the master and to furnish him with all the material benefits befitting his supremacy. But this means that, in the end, only the slave knows what reality and the resistance of matter really are; only the slave can attain some true materialistic consciousness of his situation, since it is precisely to that that he is condemned. The Master, however, is condemned to idealism-to the luxury of a placeless freedom in which any consciousness of his own concrete situation flees like a dream, like a word unremembered on the tip of the tongue, a nagging doubt which the puzzled mind is unable to formulate.

It strikes me that we Americans, we masters of the world, are in something of that very same position. The view from the top is epistemologically crippling, and reduces its subjects to the illusions of a host of fragmented subjectivities, to the poverty of the individual experience of isolated monads, to dying individual bodies without collective pasts or futures bereft of any possibility of grasping the social totality. This placeless individuality, this structural idealism which affords us the luxury of the Sartrean blink, offers a welcome escape from the ""nightmare of history,"" but at the same time it condemns our culture to psychologism and the ""projections"" of private subjectivity. All of this is denied to third-world culture, which must be situational and materialist despite itself. And it is this, finally, which must account for the allegorical nature of third-world culture, where the telling of the individual story and the individual experience cannot but ultimately

86

involve the whole laborious telling of the experience of the collectivity itself.

I hope I have suggested the epistemological priority of this unfamiliar kind of allegorical vision; but I must admit that old habits die hard, and that for us such unaccustomed exposure to reality, or to the collective totality, is often intolerable, leaving us in Quentin's position at the end of Absalom, Absalom!, murmuring the great denial, “Idon't hate the Third World! I don't! I don't! I don't!""

Even that resistance is instructive, however; and we may well feel, confronted with the daily reality of the other two-thirds of the globe, that ""there was nothing at all attractive about it in fact."" But we must not allow ourselves that feeling without also acknowledging its ultimate mocking completion: ""Its life was based on the principles of community interdependence.""

Besides mode-of-production theory, whose validity is in any case widely debated, there have also appeared in recent years a number of important synthesizing works on third-world history as a unified field. Three works in particular deserve mention: Global Rift, by L.S. Stavrianos (Morrow, 1981); Europe and the People without History, by Eric R. Wolf (California, 1982), and The Three Worlds, by Peter Worsley (Chicago, 1984). Such works suggest a more general methodological consequence implicit in the present essay but which should be stated explicitly here: first, that the kind of comparative work demanded by this concept of third-world literature involves comparison, not of the individual texts, which are formally and culturally very different from each other, but of the concrete situations from which such texts spring and to which they constitute distinct responses; and second, that such an approach suggests the possibility of a literary and cultural comparatism of a new type, distantly modelled on the new comparative history of Barrington Moore and exemplified in books like Theda Skocpol's States and Social Revolutions or Eric Wolf's Peasant Revolutions of the 20th Century. Such a

87

New cultural comparatism would juxtapose the study of the differences and similarities of specific literary and cultural texts with a more typological analysis of the various socio-cultural situations from which they spring, an analysis whose variables would necessarily include such features as the inter­ relationship of social classes, the role of intellectuals, the dynamics of language and writing, the configuration of traditional forms, the relationship to western influences, the development of urban experience and money, and so forth. Such comparatism, however, need not be restricted to third-world literature.

ness according to which ""mapping"" or the grasping of the social totality is structurally available to the dominated rather than the dominating classes.

What is here called ""national allegory"" is clearly a form of just such mapping of the totaliry, so that the present essay-which sketches a theory of the cognitive aesthetics of third-world literature-forms a pendant to the essay on postmodernism which describes the logic of the cultural imperalism of the first world and above all of the United States.","[('It is also a dense text in its own right, fully as much a work of art as any of the greatest stories.', [['I couldn’t resist making another annotation here about Jameson’s characterization of Lu Xun’s preface.

When we find that centrality confirmed by the observation that the very rich Chinese vocabulary for sexual matters is extraordinarily intertwined with the language of eating; and when we observe the multiple uses to which the verb “to eat” is put in ordinary Chinese language (one “eats” a fear or a fright, for example), we may feel in a somewhat better position to sense the enormous sensitivity of this libidinal region, and of Lu Xun’s mobilization of it for the dramatization of an essentially social nightmare-something which in a western writer would be consigned to the realm of the merely private obsession, the vertical dimension of the personal trauma.', [['This analysis is valid, useful, and important.

I am preparing to sing the madness of the prophetic bard, and a humorous poem on Merlin; pray correct the song, Robert 1, glory of bishops, by restraining my pen.  For we know that Philosophy has poured over you its divine nectar, and has made you famous in all things, that you might serve as an example, a leader and a teacher in the world.  Therefore may you favour my attempt, and see fit to look upon the poet with better auspices than you did that other whom you have just succeeded, promoted to an honour that you deserve.  For indeed you habits, and your approved life, and your birth, and your usefulness to the position, and the clergy and the people all were seeking it for you, and from this circumstance happy Lincoln is just now exalted to the stars.  On this account I might wish you to be embraced in a fitting song, but I am not equal to the task, even though Orpheus, and Camerinus 2, and Macer, and Marius, and mighty-voiced Rabirius were all to sing with my mouth and all the Muses were to accompany me.  But now, Sisters, accustomed to sing with me, let us sing the work proposed, and strike the cithara.



Well then, after many years had passed under many kings, Merlin the Briton was held famous in the world.  He was a king and prophet; to the proud people of the South Welsh he gave laws, and to the chieftains he prophesied the future.  Meanwhile it happened that a strife arose 3 between several of the chiefs of the kingdom, and throughout the cities they wasted the innocent people with fierce war. 4  Peredur, king of the North Welsh, made war on Gwenddoleu, who ruled the realm of Scotland; and already the day fixed for the battle was at hand, and the leaders were ready in the field, and the troops were fighting, falling on both sides in a miserable slaughter.  Merlin had come to the war with Peredur and so had Rhydderch, king of the Cumbrians, 5 both savage men.  They slew the opposing enemy with their hateful swords, and three brothers of the prince 6 who had followed him through his wars, always fighting, cut down and broke the battle lines.  Thence they rushed fiercely through the crowded ranks with such an attack that they soon fell killed.  At this sight, Merlin, you grieved and poured out sad complaints throughout the army, and cried out in these words, “Could injurious fate be so harmful as to take from me so many and such great companions, whom recently so many kings and so many remote kingdoms feared?  O dubious lot of mankind!  O death ever near, which has them always in its power, and strikes its hidden goad and drives out the wretched life from the body!  O glorious youths, who now will stand by my side in arms, and with me will repel the chieftains coming to harm me, and the hosts rushing in upon me?  Bold young men your audacity has taken from you your pleasant years and pleasant youth!  You who so recently were rushing in arms through the troops, cutting down on every side those who resisted you, now are beating the ground and are red with red blood!”  So among the hosts he lamented with flowing tears, and mourned for the men, and the savage battle was unceasing.  The lines rushed together, enemies were slain by enemies, blood flowed everywhere, and people died on both sides.  But at length the Britons assembled their troops from all quarters and all together rushing in arms they fell upon the Scots and wounded them and cut them down, nor did they rest until the hostile battalions turned their backs and fled through unfrequented ways.



Merlin called his companions out from the battle and bade them bury the brothers in a richly coloured chapel; and he bewailed the men and did not cease to pour out laments, and he strewed dust on his hair and rent his garments, and prostrate on the ground rolled now hither and now thither.  Peredur strove to console him and so did the nobles and princes, but he would not be comforted nor put up with their beseeching words.  He had now lamented for three whole days and had refused food, so great was the grief that consumed him.  Then when he had filled the air with so many and so great complaints, new fury seized him 7 and he departed secretly, and fled to the woods not wishing to be seen as he fled.  He entered the wood and rejoiced to lie hidden under the ash trees; he marvelled at the wild beasts feeding on the grass of the glades; now he chased after them and again he flew past them; he lived on the roots of grasses and on the grass, on the fruit of the trees and on the mulberries of the thicket.  He became a silvan man just as though devoted to the woods.  For a whole summer after this, hidden like a wild animal, he remained buried in the woods, found by no one and forgetful of himself and of his kindred.  But when the winter came and took away all the grass and the fruit of the trees and he had nothing to live on, he poured out the following lament in a wretched voice.



“Christ, God of heaven, 8 what shall I do?  In what part of the world can I stay, since I see nothing here I can live on, neither grass on the ground nor acorns on the trees?  Here once there stood nineteen apple trees 9 bearing apples every year; now they are not standing.  Who has taken them away from me?  Whither have they gone all of a sudden?  Now I see them - now I do not!  Thus the fates fight against me and for me, since they both permit and forbid me to see.  Now I lack the apples and everything else.  The trees stand without leaves, without fruit; I am afflicted by both circumstances since I cannot cover myself with the leaves or eat the fruit.  Winter and the south wind with its falling rain have taken them all away.  If by chance I find some navews [turnips] deep in the ground the hungry swine and the voracious boars rush up and snatch them away from me as I dig them up from the turf.  You, O wolf, dear companion, accustomed to roam with me through the secluded paths of the woods and meadows, now can scarcely get across fields; hard hunger has weakened both you and me.  You lived in these woods before I did and age has whitened your hairs first.  You have nothing to put into your mouth and do not know how to get anything, at which I marvel, since the wood abounds in so many goats and other wild beasts that you might catch.  Perhaps that detestable old age of yours has taken away your strength and prevented your following the chase.  Now, as the only thing left to you, you fill the air with howlings, and stretched out on the ground you extend your wasted limbs.”



These words he was uttering among the shrubs and dense hazel thickets when the sound reached a certain passer-by who turned his steps to the place whence the sounds were rising in the air, and found the place and found the speaker.  As soon as Merlin saw him he departed, and the traveller followed him, but was unable to overtake the man as he fled.  Thereupon he resumed his journey and went about his business, moved by the lot of the fugitive.  Now this traveller was met by a man from the court of Rhydderch, king of the Cumbrians, who was married to Ganieda and happy in his beautiful wife.  She was sister to Merlin and, grieving over the fate of her brother, she had sent her retainers to the woods and the distant fields to bring him back.  One of these retainers came toward the traveller and the latter at once went up to him and they fell into conversation; the one who had been sent to find Merlin asked if the other had seen him in the woods or the glades.  The latter admitted that he had seen such a man among the bushy glades of the Calidonian forest, 10 but, when he wished to speak to him and sit down with him, the other had fled away swiftly among the oaks.  These things he told, and the messenger departed and entered the forest; he searched the deepest valleys and passed over the high mountains; he sought everywhere for his man, going through the obscure places.



On the very summit of a certain mountain there was a fountain, surrounded on every side by hazel bushes and thick with shrubs.  There Merlin had seated himself, and thence through all the woods he watched the wild animals running and playing.  Thither the messenger climbed, and with silent step went on up the heights seeking the man.  At last he saw the fountain and Merlin sitting on the grass behind it, and making his plaint in this manner.


“O Thou who rulest all things, how does it happen that the seasons are not all the same, distinguished only by their four numbers?  Now spring, according to its laws, provides flowers and leaves; summer gives crops, autumn ripe apples; icy winter follows and devours and wastes all the others, bringing rain and snow, and keeps them all away and harms with its tempests.  And it does not permit the ground to produce variegated [various?] flowers, or the oak trees acorns, or the apple trees dark red apples.  O that there were no winter or white frost!  That it were spring or summer, and that the cuckoo would come back singing, and the nightingale who softens sad hearts with her devoted song, and the turtle dove keeping her chaste vows, and that in new foliage other birds should sing in harmonious measures, delighting me with their music, while a new earth should breathe forth odours from new flowers under the green grass; that the fountains would also flow on every side with their gentle murmurs, and near by, under the leaves, the dove would pour forth her soothing laments and incite to slumber.”



The messenger heard the prophet and broke off his lament with cadences on the cither he had brought with him that with it he might attract and soften the madman. 11  Therefore making plaintive sounds with his fingers and striking the strings in order, he lay hidden behind him and sang in a low voice, “O the dire groanings of mournful Guendoloena!  O the wretched tears of weeping Guendoloena!  I grieve for wretched dying Guendoloena!  There was not among the Welsh a woman more beautiful than she.  She surpassed in fairness the goddesses, and the petals of the privet, and the blooming roses and the fragrant lilies of the fields.  The glory of spring shone in her alone, and she had the splendour of the stars in her two eyes, and splendid hair shining with the gleam of gold.  All this has perished; all beauty has departed from her, both colour and figure and also the glory of her snowy flesh.  Now, worn with much weeping, she is not what she was, for she does not know where the prince has gone, or whether he is alive or dead; therefore the wretched woman languishes and is totally wasted away through her long grief.  With similar laments Ganieda weeps with her, and without consolation grieves for her lost brother.  One weeps for her brother and the other for her husband, and both devote themselves to weeping and spend their time in sadness.  No food nourishes them, nor does any sleep refresh them wandering at night through the brushwood, so great is the grief that consumes them both.  Not otherwise did Sidonian Dido grieve when the ships had weighed anchor and Aeneas was in haste to depart; so most wretched Phyllis groaned and wept when Demophoon did not come back at the appointed time; thus Briseis wept for the absent Achilles. 12  Thus the sister and the wife grieve together, and burn continually and completely with inward agonies.”



The messenger sang thus to his plaintive lyre, and with his music soothed the ears of the prophet that he might become more gentle and rejoice with the singer.  Quickly the prophet arose and addressed the young man with pleasant words, and begged him to touch once more the strings with his fingers and to sing again his former song.  The latter therefore set his fingers to the lyre and played over again the song that was asked for, and by his playing compelled the man, little by little, to put aside his madness, captivated by the sweetness of the lute.  So Merlin became mindful of himself, and he recalled what he used to be, and he wondered at his madness and he hated it.  His former mind returned and his sense came back to him, and, moved by affection, he groaned at the names of his sister and of his wife, since his mind was now restored to him, and he asked to be led to the court of King Rhydderch.  The other obeyed him, and straightway they left the woods and came, rejoicing together, to the city of the king.  So the queen was delighted by regaining her brother and the wife became glad over the return of her husband.  They vied with each other in kissing him and they twined their arms about his neck, so great was the affection that moved them.  The king also received him with such honour as was fitting, and the chieftains who thronged the palace rejoiced in the city.



But when Merlin saw such great crowds of men present he was not able to endure them; he went mad again, and, filled anew with fury, he wanted to go to the woods, and he tried to get away by stealth.  Then Rhydderch ordered him to be restrained and a guard posted over him, and his madness to be softened with the cither; and he stood about him grieving, and with imploring words begged the man to be sensible and to stay with him, and not to long for the grove or to live like a wild beast, or to want to abide under the trees when he might hold a royal sceptre and rule over a warlike people.  After that he promised that he would give him many gifts, and he ordered people to bring him clothing and birds, dogs and swift horses, gold and shining gems, and cups that Wayland had engraved in the city of Segontium. 13  Every one of these things Rydderch offered to the prophet and urged him to stay with him and leave the woods.



The prophet rejected these gifts, saying, “Let the dukes who are troubled by their own poverty have these, they who are not satisfied with a moderate amount but desire a great deal.  To these gifts I prefer the groves and broad oaks of Calidon, and the lofty mountains with green pastures at their feet.  Those are the things that please me, not these of yours - take these away with you, King Rhydderch.  My Calidonian forest rich in nuts, the forest that I prefer to everything else, shall have me.”



Finally since the king could not retain the sad man by any gifts, he ordered him to be bound with a strong chain lest, if free, he might seek the deserted groves.  The prophet, when he felt the chains around him and he could not go as a free man to the Calidonian forests, straightway fell to grieving and remained sad and silent, and took all joy from his face so that he did not utter a word or smile.


Meanwhile the queen was going through the hall looking for the king, and he, as was proper, greeted her as she came and took her by the hand and bade her sit down, and, embracing her, pressed her lips in a kiss.  In so doing he turned his face toward her and saw a leaf hanging in her hair; 14 he reached out his fingers, took it and threw it on the ground, and jested joyfully with the woman he loved.  The prophet turned his eyes in that direction and smiled, and made the the men standing about look at him in wonder since he was not in the habit of smiling.  The king too wondered and urged the madman to tell the cause of his sudden laugh, and he added to his words many gifts.  The other was silent and put off explaining his laugh.  But more and more Rhydderch continued to urge him with riches and with entreaties until at length the prophet, vexed at him, said in return for his gift, “A miser loves a gift and a greedy man labours to get one; these are easily corrupted by gifts and bend their minds in any direction they are bidden to.  What they have is not enough for them, but for me the acorns of pleasant Calidon and the shining fountains flowing through fragrant meadows are sufficient.  I am not attracted by gifts; let the miser take his, and unless liberty is given me and I go back to the green woodland valleys I shall refuse to explain my laughter.”



Therefore when Rhydderch found that he could not influence the prophet by any gift, and he could not find out the reason for the laughter, straightway he ordered the chains to be loosed and gave him permission to seek the deserted groves, that he might be willing to give the desired explanation.  Then Merlin, rejoicing that he could go, said, “This is the reason I laughed, Rhydderch.  You were by a single act both praiseworthy and blameworthy.  When just now you removed the leaf that the queen had in her hair without knowing it, you acted more faithfully toward her than she did toward you when she went under the bush where her lover met her and lay with her; and while she was lying there supine with her hair spread out, by chance there caught in it the leaf that you, not knowing all this, removed.”



Rhydderch suddenly became sad at this accusation and turned his face from her and cursed the day he had married her.  But she, not at all moved, hid her shame behind a smiling face and said to her husband, “Why are you sad, my love?  Why do you become so angry over this thing and blame me unjustly, and believe a madman who, lacking sound sense, mixes lies with the truth?  The man who believes him becomes many times more a fool than he is.  Now then, watch, and if I am not mistaken I will show you that he is crazy and has not spoken the truth.”



There was in the hall a certain boy, one of many, and the ingenious woman catching sight of him straightway thought of a novel trick by which she might convict her brother of falsehood. 15  So she ordered the boy to come in and asked her brother to predict by what death the lad should die.  He answered, “Dearest sister, he shall die, when a man, by falling from a high rock.”  Smiling at these words, she ordered the boy to go away and take off the clothes he was wearing and put on others and to cut off his long hair; she bade him come back to them thus that he might seem to them a different person.  The boy obeyed her, for he came back to them with his clothes changed as he had been ordered to do.  Soon the queen asked her brother again, “Tell your dear sister what the death of this boy will be like.”  Merlin answered, “This boy when he grows up shall, while out of his mind, meet with a violent death in a tree.”  When he had finished she said to her husband, “Could this false prophet lead you so far astray as to make you believe that I had committed so great a crime?  And if you will notice with how much sense he has spoken this about the boy, you will believe that the things he said about me were made up so that he might get away to the woods.  Far be it from me to do such a thing!  I shall keep my bed chaste, and chaste shall I always be while the breath of life is in me.  I convicted him of falsehood when I asked him about the death of the boy.  Now I shall do it again; pay attention and judge.”



When she had said this she told the boy in an aside to go out and put on woman’s clothing, and to come back thus.  Soon the boy left and did as he was bid, for he came back in woman’s clothes just as though he were a woman, and stood in front of Merlin to whom the queen said banteringly, “Say brother, tell me about the death of this girl.”  “Girl or not she shall die in the river,” said her brother to her, which made King Rhydderch laugh at his reasoning; since when asked about the death of a single boy Merlin had predicted three different kinds.  Therefore Rhydderch thought he had spoken falsely about the queen, and did not believe him, but grieved, and hated the fact that he had trusted him and had condemned his beloved.  The queen, seeing this, forgave him and kissed and caressed him and made him joyful.



Meanwhile Merlin planned to go to the woods, and he left his dwelling and ordered the gates to be opened; but his sister stood in his way and with rising tears begged him to remain with her for a while and to put aside his madness.  The hard-hearted man would not desist from his project but kept trying to open the doors, and he strove to leave and raged and fought and by his clamour forced the servants to open.  At length, since no one could hold him back when he wanted to go, the queen quickly ordered Guendoloena, who was absent, to come to make him desist.  She came and on her knees begged him to remain; but he spurned her prayers and would not stay, nor would he, as he was accustomed to do, look upon her with a joyful face.  She grieved and dissolved in tears and tore her hair, and scratched her cheeks with her nails and rolled on the ground as though dying.  The queen seeing this said to him, “This Guendoloena who is dying thus for you, what shall she do?  Shall she marry again or do you bid her remain a widow, or go with you wherever you are going?  For she will go, and with you she will joyfully inhabit the groves and the green woodland meadows provided she has your love.”  To this the prophet answered, “Sister I do not want a cow that pours out water in a broad fountain like the urn of the Virgin in summer-time, nor shall I change my care as Orpheus once did when Eurydice gave her baskets to the boys to hold before she swam back across the Stygian sands.  Freed from both of you I shall remain without the taint of love.  Let her therefore be given a proper opportunity to marry and let him whom she shall choose have her.  But let the man who marries her be careful that he never gets in my way or comes near me; let him keep away for fear lest if I happen to meet him he may feel my flashing sword.  But when the day of the solemn [formal] wedding comes and the different viands are distributed to the guests, I shall be present in person, furnished with seemly gifts, and I shall profusely endow Guendoloena when she is given away.”  When he had finished he said farewell to each of them and went away, and with no one to hinder him he went back to the woods he longed for.



Guendoloena remained sadly in the door watching him and so did the queen, both moved by what had happened to their friend, and they marvelled that a madman should be so familiar with secret things and should have known of the love affair of his sister.  Nevertheless they thought that he lied about the death of the boy since he told of three different deaths when he should have told of one.  Therefore his speech seemed for long years to be an empty one until the time when the boy grew to manhood; then it was made apparent to all and convincing to many.  For while he was hunting with his dogs he caught sight of a stag hiding in a grove of trees; he loosed the dogs who, as soon as they saw the stag, climbed through unfrequented ways and filled the air with their baying.  He urged on his horse with his spurs and followed after, and urged on the huntsmen, directing them, now with his horn and now with his voice, and he bade them go more quickly.  There was a high mountain surrounded on all sides by rocks with a stream flowing through the plain at its foot; thither the animal fled until he came to the river, seeking a hiding place after the usual manner of its kind.  The young man pressed on and passed straight over the mountain, hunting for the stag among the rocks lying about.  Meanwhile it happened, while his impetuosity was leading him on, that his horse slipped from a high rock and the man fell over a precipice into the river, but so that one of his feet caught in a tree, and the rest of his body was submerged in the stream.  Thus he fell, and was drowned, and hung from a tree, and by his threefold death made the prophet a true one.


The latter meanwhile had gone to the woods and was living like a wild beast, subsisting on frozen moss, in the snow, in the rain, in the cruel blasts of the wind.  And this pleased him more than administering laws throughout his cities and ruling over fierce people.  Meanwhile Guendoloena, since her husband was leading a life like this with his woodland flock through the passing years, was married in accordance with her husband’s permission.



It was night and the horns of the bright moon were shining, and all the lights of the vault of heaven were gleaming; the air was clearer than usual, for cruel, frigid, Boreas had driven away the clouds and had made the sky serene again and had dried up the mists with his arid breath.  From the top of a lofty mountain the prophet was regarding the courses of the stars, speaking to himself out in the open air.  “What does this ray of Mars mean?  Does its fresh redness mean that one king is dead and that there shall be another?  So I see it, for Constantine has died and his nephew Conan, through an evil fate and the murder of his uncle, has taken the crown and is king. 16  And you, highest Venus, who slipping along within your ordered limits beneath the zodiac are accompanying the sun in his course, what about this double ray of yours that is cleaving the air?  Does not its division indicate a severing of my love?  Such a ray indeed shows that loves are divided.  Perhaps Guendoloena has left me in my absence and now clings to another man and rejoices in his embraces.  So I lose; so another enjoys her.  So my rights are taken away from me while I dally.  So it is surely, for a slothful lover is beaten by one who is not slothful or absent but is right on hand.  But I am not jealous; let her marry now under favourable auspices and let her enjoy her new husband with my permission.  And when tomorrow’s sun shall shine I will go and take with me the gift I promised her when I left.”  So he spoke and went about all the woods and groves and collected a herd of stags in a single line, and the deer and she-goats likewise, and he himself mounted a stag. 17  And when day dawned he came quickly, driving the line before him to the place where Guendoloena was to be married.  When he arrived he forced the stags to stand patiently outside the gates while he cried aloud, “Guendoloena!  Guendoloena!  Come!  Your presents are looking for you!”  Guendoloena therefore came quickly, smiling and marvelling that the man was riding on the stag and that it obeyed him, and that he could get together so large a number of animals and drive them before him just as a shepherd does the sheep that he is in the habit of driving to the pastures.



The bridegroom stood watching from a lofty window and marvelling at the rider on his seat, and he laughed.  But when the prophet saw him and understood who he was, at once he wrenched the horns from the stag he was riding and shook them and threw them at the man and completely smashed his head in, and killed him and drove out his life into the air.  With a quick blow of his heels he set the stag flying and was on his way back to the woods.  At these happenings the servants rushed out from all sides and quickly followed the prophet through the fields.  But he ran ahead so fast that he would have reached the woods untouched if a river had not been in his way; while his beast was hurriedly leaping over the torrent Merlin slipped from his back and fell into the rapid waves.  The servants lined the shore and captured him as he swam, and bound him and took him home and gave him to his sister.



The prophet, captured in this way, became sad and wanted to go back to the woods, and he fought to break his bonds and refused to smile or to take food or drink, and by his sadness he made his sister sad.  Rhydderch, therefore, seeing him drive all joy from him and refuse to taste of the banquets that had been prepared for him, took pity on him and ordered him to be led out into the city, through the market place among the people, in the hope that he might be cheered up by going and seeing the novelties that were being sold there.



After he had been taken out and was going away from the palace he saw before a door a servant of a poor appearance, the doorkeeper, asking with trembling lips of all the passers-by some money with which to get his clothes mended. 18  The prophet thereupon stood still and laughed, wondering at the poor man.  When he had gone on from here he saw a young man holding some new shoes and buying some pieces of leather to patch them with.  Then he laughed again and refused to go further through the market place to be stared at by the people he was watching.  But he yearned for the woods, toward which he frequently looked back, and to which, although forbidden, he tried to direct his steps.



The servants returned home and told that he had laughed twice and also that he had tried to get away to the woods.  Rhydderch, who wished to know what he had meant by his laughter, quickly gave orders for his bonds to be loosed and gave him permission to go back to his accustomed woods if only he would explain why he laughed.  The prophet, now quite joyful, answered, “The doorkeeper was sitting outside the doors in well worn clothing and kept asking those who went by to give him something to buy clothes with, just as though he had been a pauper, and all the time he was secretly a rich man and had under him hidden piles of coins.  That is what I laughed at; turn up the ground under him and you will find coins preserved there for a long time.  From there they led me further toward the market place and I saw a man buying some shoes and also some patches so that after the shoes were wornout and had holes in them from use he might mend them and make them fit for service again.  This too I laughed at since the poor man will not be able to use the shoes nor,” he added, “the patches, since he is already drowned in the waves and is floating toward the shore; go and you will see.”  Rhydderch, wishing to test the man’s sayings, ordered his servants to go quickly along the bank of the river, so that if they should chance to find such a man drowned by the shore they might at once bring him word.  They obeyed the king’s orders, for going along the the river they found a drowned man in a waste patch of sand, and returned home and reported the fact to him.  But the king meanwhile, after sending away the doorkeeper, had dug and turned up the ground and found a treasure placed under it, and laughingly he worshipped the prophet.



After these things had happened the prophet was making haste to go to the woods he was accustomed to, hating the people in the city.  The queen advised him to stay with her and to put off his desired trip to the woods until the cold of white winter, which was then at hand, should be over, and summer should return again with its tender fruits on which he could live while the weather grew warm from the sun.  He refused, and desirous of departing and scorning the winter he said to her, “O dear sister, why do you labour to hold me back?  Winter with his tempests cannot frighten me, nor icy Boreas when he rages with his cruel blasts and suddenly injures the flocks of sheep with hail; neither does Auster disturb me when its rain clouds shed their waters.  Why should I not seek the deserted groves and the green woodlands?  Content with a little I can endure the frost.  There under the leaves of the trees among the odorous blossoms I shall take pleasure in lying through the summer; but lest I lack food in winter you might build me a house in the woods and have servants in it to wait on me and prepare me food when the ground refuses to produce grain or the trees fruit.  Before the other buildings build me a remote one with seventy doors and as many windows through which I may watch fire-breathing Phoebus and Venus and the stars gliding from the heavens by night, all of whom shall show me what is going to happen to the people of the kingdom.  And let the same number of scribes be at hand, trained to take my dictation, and let them be attentive to record my prophecy on their tablets. 19  You too are to come often, dear sister, and then you can relieve my hunger with food and drink.”  After he had finished speaking he departed hastily for the woods.



His sister obeyed him and built the place he had asked for, and the other houses and whatever else he had bid her.  But he, while the apples remained and Phoebus was ascending higher through the stars, rejoiced to remain beneath the leaves and to wander through the groves with their soothing breezes.  Then winter came, harsh with icy winds, and despoiled the ground and the trees of all their fruit, and Merlin lacked food because the rains were at hand, and he came, sad and hungry, to the aforesaid place.  Thither the queen often came and rejoiced to bring her brother both food and drink.  He, after he had refreshed himself with various kinds of edibles, would arise and express his approval of his sister.  Then wandering about the house he would look at the stars while he prophecied things like these which he knew were going to come to pass.



“O madness of the Britons whom a plenitude, always excessive, of riches exalts more than is seemly. 20  They do not wish to enjoy peace but are stirred up by the Fury’s goad.  They engage in civil wars and battles between relatives, and permit the church of the Lord to fall into ruin; the holy bishops they drive into remote lands.  The nephews of the Boar of Cornwall 21 cast everything into confusion, and setting snares for each other engage in a mutual slaughter with their wicked swords.  They do not wish to wait to get possession of the kingdom lawfully, but seize the crown.  The fourth 22 from them shall be more cruel and more harsh still; him shall a wolf from the sea conquer in fight and shall drive defeated beyond the Severn through the kingdoms of the barbarians.  This latter shall besiege Cirencester with a blockade and with sparrows, and shall overthrow its walls to their very bases.  He shall seek the Gauls in his ship, but shall die beneath the weapon of a king.  Rhydderch shall die, 23 after whom long discord shall hold the Scots and the Cumbrians for a long time until Cumbria shall be granted to his growing tusk.  The Welsh shall attack the men of Gwent, 24 and afterwards those of Cornwall and no law shall restrain them.  Wales shall rejoice in the shedding of blood; O people always hateful to God, why do you rejoice in bloodshed?  Wales shall compel brothers to fight and to condemn their own relatives to a wicked death.  The troops of the Scots shall often cross the Humber and, putting aside all sentiment, shall kill those who oppose them.  Not with impunity, however, for the leader shall be killed; he shall have the name of a horse 25 and because of that fact shall be fierce.  His heir shall be expelled and shall depart from our territories.  Scots, sheathe your swords which you bare too readily; your strength shall be unequal to that of our fierce people.  The city of Dumbarton 26 shall be destroyed and no king shall repair it for an age until the Scot shall be subdued in war.  Carlisle, spoiled of its shepherd, shall lie vacant until the sceptre of the Lion shall restore its pastoral staff. 27  Segontium and its towers and mighty palaces shall lament in ruins until the Welsh return to their former domains. 28  Porchester shall see its broken walls in its harbour until a rich man with the tooth of a wolf shall restore it.  The city of Richborough 29 shall lie spread out on the shore of its harbour and a man from Flanders 30 shall re-establish it with his crested ship.  The fifth from him shall rebuild the walls of St David’s and shall bring back to her  the pall lost for many years. 31  The City of the Legions 32 shall fall into thy bosom, O Severn, and shall lose her citizens for a long time, and these the Bear in the Lamb 33 shall restore to her when he shall come.



Saxon kings shall expel the citizens and shall hold cities, country, and houses for a long time.  From among them thrice three dragons shall wear the crown.  Two hundred monks shall perish in Leicester 34 and the Saxon shall drive out her ruler and leave vacant her walls.  He who first among the Angles shall wear the diadem of Brutus 35 shall repair the city laid waste by slaughter.  A fierce people shall forbid the sacrament of confirmation throughout the country, and in the house of God shall place images of the gods.  Afterward Rome shall bring God back through the medium of a monk and a holy priest shall sprinkle the buildings with water and shall restore them again and shall place shepherds in them.  Thereafter many of them shall obey the commands of the divine law and shall enjoy heaven by right.  An impious people full of poison shall violate that settlement and shall violently mix together right and wrong.  They shall sell their sons and their kinsmen into the furthest countries beyond the sea and shall incur the wrath of the Thunderer.  O wretched crime! that man whom the founder of the world created with liberty, deeming him worthy of heaven, should be sold like an ox and be dragged away with a rope.  You miserable man who turned traitor to your master when first you came to the throne, you shall yield to God.  The Danes 36 shall come upon [you] with their fleet and after subduing the people shall reign for a short time and shall then be defeated and retire.  Two shall rule over them 37 whom the serpent forgetful of his treaty shall strike with the sting in his tail instead of with the garland of his sceptre.



Then the Normans, 38 sailing over the water in their wooden ships, bearing their faces in front and in back, shall fiercely attack the Angles with their iron tunics and their fierce swords, and shall destroy them and possess the field.  They shall subjugate many realms to themselves and shall rule foreign peoples for a time until the Fury, flying all about, shall scatter her poison over them.  Then peace and faith and all virtue shall depart, and on all sides throughout the country the citizens shall engage in battles.  Man shall betray man and no one shall be found a friend.  The husband, despising his wife, shall draw near to harlots, and the wife, despising her husband, shall marry whom she desires.  There shall be no honour kept for the church and the order shall perish.  Then shall bishops bear arms, and armed camps shall be built.  Men shall build towers and walls in holy ground, and they shall give to the soldiers what should belong to the needy.  Carried away by riches they shall run along on the path of worldly things and shall take from God what the holy bishop shall forbid.  Three shall wear the diadem 38 after whom shall be the favour of the newcomers.  A fourth shall be in authority whom awkward piety shall injure until he shall be clothed in his father, so that girded with boar’s teeth he shall cross the shadow of the helmeted man. 39  Four shall be anointed, seeking in turn the highest things, and two shall succeed who shall so wear the diadem that they shall induce the Gauls to make war on them.  The sixth shall overthrow the irish and their walls, and pious and prudent shall renew the people and the cities.  All these things I formerly predicted more at length to Vortigern in explaining to him the mystic war of the two dragons when we sat on the banks of the drained pool. 40  But you, dear sister, go home to see the king dying and bid Taliesin come, as I wish to talk over many things with him; for he has recently come from the land of Brittany where he learned sweet philosophy of Gildas the Wise.” 41



Ganieda returned home and found that Taliesin had returned and the prince was dead and the servants were sad.  She fell down lamenting among her friends and tore her hair and cried, “Women, lament with me the death of Rhydderch and weep for a man such as our earth has not produced hitherto in our age so far as we know.  He was a lover of peace, for he so ruled a fierce people that no violence was done to any one by any one else.  He treated the holy priest with just moderation 42 and permitted the highest and the lowest to be governed by law.  He was generous, for he gave away much and kept scarcely anything.  He was all things to all men, doing whatever was seemly; flower of knights, glory of kings, pillar of the kingdom.  Woe is me! for what you were - now so unexpectedly you have become food for worms, and your body moulders in the urn.  Is this the bed prepared for you after fine silks?  Is it true that your white flesh and royal limbs will be covered by a cold stone, that you will be nothing but dust and bones?  So it is, for the miserable lot of mankind goes on throughout the years so that they cannot be brought back to their former estate.  Therefore there is no profit in the bravery of the transient world that flees and returns, deceives and injures the mighty.  The bee anoints with its honey what it afterwards stings.  So also those whom the glory of the world caresses as it departs it deceives and smites with with its disagreeable sting.  That which excels is of brief duration, what it has does not endure; like running water everything that is of service passes away.  What is a rose if it blushes, a snowy lily if it blooms, a man or a horse or anything else if it is fair!  These things should be referred to the Creator, not to the world.  Happy therefore are those who remain firm in a pious heart and serve God and renounce the world.  To them Christ who reigns without end, the Creator of all things, shall grant to enjoy perpetual honour.  Therefore I leave you, ye nobles, ye lofty walls, household gods, sweet sons, and all the things of the world.  In company with my brother I shall dwell in the woods and shall worship God with a joyful heart, clothed in a black mantle.”  So she spoke, giving her husband his due, and she inscribed on his tomb this verse, “Rhydderch the Generous, than whom there was no one more generous in the world, a great man rests in this small urn.” 42bis



Meanwhile Taliesin had come to see Merlin the prophet who had sent for him to find out what wind or rain storm was coming up, for both together were drawing near and the clouds were thickening.  He drew the following illustrations under the guidance of Minerva his associate.



“Out of nothing the Creator of the world produced four [elements] that they might be the prior cause as well as the material for creating all things when they were joined together in harmony: 43 the heaven which He adorned with stars and which stands on high and embraces everything like the shell surrounding a nut; then He made the air, fir for forming sounds, through the medium of which day and night present the stars; the sea which girds the land in four circles, and with its mighty refluence so strikes the air as to generate the winds which are said to be four in number; as a foundation He placed the earth, standing by its own strength and not lightly moved, which is divided into five parts, whereof the middle one is not habitable because of the heat and the two furthest are shunned because of their cold.  To the last two He gave moderate temperature and these are inhabited by men and birds and herds of wild beasts.  He added clouds to the sky so that they might furnish sudden showers to make the fruits of the trees and of the ground grow with their gentle sprinkling.  With the help of the sun these are filled like water skins from the rivers by a hidden law, and then, rising through the upper air, they pour out the water they have taken up, driven by the force of the winds.  From them come rain storms, snow, and round hail when the cold damp wind breathes out its blasts which, penetrating the clouds, drive out the streams just as they make them.  Each of the winds takes to itself a nature of its own from its proximity to the zone where it is born.  Beyond the firmament in which He fixed the shining stars He placed the ethereal heaven and gave it as a habitation to troops of angels whom the worthy contemplation and marvellous sweetness of God refresh throughout the ages.  This also He adorned with stars and the shining sun, laying down the law by which the star should run within fixed limits through the part of heaven entrusted to it.  He afterwards placed beneath this the airy heavens, shining with the lunar body, which throughout their high places abound in troops of spirits who sympathize or rejoice with us as things go well or ill.  They are accustomed to carry the prayers of men through the air and to beseech God to have mercy on them, and to bring back intimations of God’s will, either in dreams or by voice or by other signs, through doing which they become wise.  The space beyond the moon abounds in evil demons, who are skilled to cheat and deceive and tempt us; often they assume a body made of air and appear to us and many things often follow.  They even hold intercourse with women and make them pregnant, generating in an unholy manner. 44  So therefore He made the heavens to be inhabited by three orders of spirits that each one might look out for something and renew the world from the renewed seed of things.



The sea too He distinguished by various forms that from itself it might produce the forms of things, generating throughout the ages.  Indeed, part of it burns and part freezes and the third part, getting a moderate temperature from the other two, ministers to our needs.  That part which burns surrounds a gulf and fierce people, and its divers streams, flowing back, separate this from the orb of the earth, increasing fire from fire.  Thither descend those who transgress the laws and reject God; whither their perverse will leads them they go, eager to destroy what is forbidden to them.  There stands the stern eyed judge holding his equal balance and giving to each one his merits and his deserts.  The second part, which freezes, rolls about the foreshore sands which it is the first to generate from the near-by vapour when it is mingled with the ray of Venus’ star.  This star, the Arabs say, makes shining gems when it passes through Pisces [the fishes] while its waters look back at the flames.  These gems by their virtues benefit the people who wear them, and make many well and keep them so.  These too the Maker distinguished by their kinds (as He did all things), that we might discern from their forms and from their colours of what kinds they are and of what manifest virtues.  The third form of the sea which circles our orb furnishes us many good things owing to its proximity.  For it nourishes fishes and produces salt in abundance, and bears back and forth ships carrying our commerce, by the profits of which the poor man becomes suddenly rich.  It makes fertile the neighbouring soil and feeds the birds who, they say, are generated from it along with the fishes and, although unlike, are moved by the laws of nature.  The sea is dominated by them more than by the fishes, and they fly lightly up from it through space and seek the lofty regions.  But its moisture drives the fishes beneath the waves and keeps them there, and does not permit them to live when they get out into the dry light.  These too the Maker distinguished according to their species and to the different ones gave each his nature, whence through the ages they were to become admirable and healthful to the sick.



For men say that the barbel restrains the heat of passion but makes blind those who eat it often. 45  The thymallus, which has its name from the flower thyme, smells so that it betrays the fish that often eats of it until all the fishes in the river smell like itself.  They say the the muraenas, contrary to all laws, are all of the feminine sex, yet they copulate and reproduce and multiply their offspring from a different kind of seed.  For often snakes come together along the shore where they are, and they make the sound of pleasing hissing and, calling out the muraenas, join with them according to custom.  It is also remarkable that the remora, half a foot long, holds fast the ship to which it adheres at sea just as though it were fast aground, and does not permit the vessel to move until it lets go; because of this power it is to be feared.  And that which they call the swordfish because it does injury with its sharp beak, people often fear to approach with a ship when it is swimming, for if it is captured it at once makes a hole in the vessel, cuts it in pieces, and sinks it suddenly in a whirlpool.  The serra makes itself feared by ships because of its crest; it fixes to them as it swims underneath, cuts them to pieces and throws the pieces into the waves, wherefore its crest is to be feared like a sword.  And the water dragon, which men say has poison under its wings, is to be feared by those who capture it; whenever it strikes it does harm by pouring out its poison.  The torpedo is said to have another kind of destruction, for if any one touches it when it is alive, straightway his arms and his feet grow torpid and so do his other members and they lose their functions just as though they were dead, so harmful is the emanation of its body.



To those and other fishes God gave the sea, and He added to it many realms among the waves, which men inhabit and which are renowned because of the fertility which the earth produces there from its fruitful soil.  Of these Britain is said to be the foremost and best, producing in its fruitfulness every single thing.  For it bears crops which throughout the year give the noble gifts of fragrance for the use of man, and it has woods and glades with honey dripping in them, and lofty mountains and broad green fields, fountains and rivers, fishes and cattle and wild beasts, fruit trees, gems, precious metals, and whatever creative nature is in the habit of furnishing.  Besides all these it has fountains healthful because of their hot waters which nourish the sick and provide pleasing baths, which quickly send people away cured with their sickness driven out.  So Bladud established them when he held the sceptre of the kingdom, 46 and he gave them the name of his consort Alaron.  These are of value to many sick because of the healing of their water, but most of all to women, as often the water has demonstrated.  Near to this island lies Thanet which abounds in many things but lacks the death-dealing serpent, and if any of its earth is drunk mixed with wine it takes away poison. 47  Our ocean also divides the Orkneys from us.  These are divided into thirty three islands by the sundering flood; twenty lack cultivation and the others are cultivated.  Thule receives its name “furthest” from the sun, because of the solstice which the summer sun makes there, turning its rays and shining no further, and taking away the day, so that always throughout the long night the air is full of shadows, and making a bridge congealed by the benumbing cold, which prevents the passage of ships.



The most outstanding island after our own is said to be Ireland with its happy fertility.  It is larger and produces no bees, and no birds except rarely, and it does not permit snakes to breed in it.  Whence it happens that if earth or a stone is carried away from there and added to any other place it drives away snakes and bees.  The island of Gades lies next to Herculean Gades, and there grows there a tree from whose bark a gum drips out of which gems are made, breaking all laws.  The Hesperides are said to contain a watchful dragon who, men say, guards the golden apples under the leaves.  The Gorgades are inhabited by women with goats’ bodies who are said to surpass hares in the swiftness of their running.  Argyre and Chryse bear, it is said, gold and silver just as Corinth does common stones.  Sri Lanka blooms pleasantly because of its fruitful soil, for it produces two crops in a single year; twice it is summer, twice spring, twice men gather grapes and other fruits, and it is also most pleasing because of its shining gems.  Tiles produces flowers and fruits in an eternal spring, green throughout the seasons.



The island of apples which men call “The Fortunate Isle” gets its name from the fact that it produces all things of itself; the fields there have no need of the ploughs of the farmers and all cultivation is lacking except what nature provides.  Of its own accord it produces grain and grapes, and apple trees grow in its woods from the close-clipped grass.  The ground of its own accord produces everything instead of merely grass, and people live there a hundred years or more.  There nine sisters rule by a pleasing set of laws those who come to them from our country. 48  She who is first of them is more skilled in the healing art, and excels her sisters in the beauty of her person.  Morgen is her name, and she has learned what useful properties all the herbs contain, so that she can cure sick bodies.  She also knows an art by which to change her shape, and to cleave the air on new wings like Daedalus; when she wishes she is at Brest, Chartres, or Pavia, 49and when she will she slips down from the air onto your shores.  And men say that she has taught mathematics to her sisters, Moronoe, Mazoe, Gliten, Glitonea, Gliton, Tyronoe, Thitis; Thitis best known for her cither.  Thither after the battle of Camlan we took the wounded Arthur, guided by Barinthus 50 to whom the waters and the stars of heaven were well known.  With him steering the ship we arrived there with the prince, and Morgen received is with fitting honour, and in her chamber she placed the king on a golden bed and with er own hand she uncovered his honourable wound and gazed at it for a long time.  At length she said that health could be restored to him if he stayed with her for a long time and made use of her healing art.  Rejoicing, therefore, we entrusted the king to her and returning spread our sails to the favouring winds.”



Merlin said in answer, “Dear friend, since that time how much the kingdom has endured from the violated oath, so that what it once was it no longer is!  For by an evil fate the nobles are roused up and turned against each other’s vitals, and they upset everything so that the abundance of riches has fled from the country and all goodness has departed, and the desolated citizens leave their walls empty.  Upon them shall come the Saxon people, fierce in war, who shall again cruelly overthrow us and our cities, and shall violate God’s law and his temples.  For He shall certainly permit this destruction to come upon us because of our crimes that He may correct the foolish.”  Merlin had scarcely finished when Taliesin exclaimed, “Then the people should send some one to tell the chief to come back in a swift ship if has recovered his strength, that he may drive off the enemy with his accustomed vigour and re-establish the citizens in their former peace.”



“No,” said Merlin, “not thus shall this people depart when once they have fixed their claws on our shores.  For at first they shall enslave our kingdom and our people and our cities, and shall dominate them with their forces for many years.  Nevertheless three 51 from among our people shall resist with much courage and shall kill many, and in the end shall overcome them.  But they shall not continue thus, for it is the will of the highest Judge that the Britons shall through weakness lose their noble kingdom for a long time, until Conan 52 shall come in his chariot from Brittany, and Cadwalader the venerated leader of the Welsh, who shall join together Scots and Cumbrians, Cornishmen and men of Brittany in a firm league, and shall return to their people their lost crown, expelling the enemy and renewing the times of Brutus, and shall deal with the cities in accordance with their consecrated laws.  And the kings shall begin again to conquer remote peoples and to subjugate their own realms to themselves in mighty conflict.”  “No one shall then be alive of those who are now living,” said Taliesin, “nor do I think that any one has seen so many savage battles between fellow citizens as you have.”  “That is so,” said Merlin, “for I have lived a long time, seeing many of them, both of our own people among themselves and of the barbarians who disturb everything.



“And I remember the crime when Constans was betrayed and the small brothers Uther and Ambrosius fled across the water. 53  At once wars began in the kingdom which now lacked a leader, for Vortigern of Gwent, 54 the consul, was leading his troops against all the nations so that he might have the leadership of them, and was inflicting a wretched death upon the harmless peasants.  At length with sudden violence he seized the crown after putting to death many of the nobles and he subdued the whole kingdom to himself.  But those who were allied to the brothers by blood relationship, offended at this, began to set fire to all the cities of the ill-fated prince and to perturb his kingdom with savage soldiery, and they would not permit him to possess it in peace.  Disquieted therefore since he could not withstand the rebellious people, he prepared to invite to the war men from far away with whose aid he might be able to meet his enemies.  Soon there came from divers parts of the world warlike bands whom he received with honour.  The Saxon people, in fact, arriving in their curved keels had come to serve him with their helmeted soldiery.  They were led by two courageous brothers, Horsus and Hengist, who afterwards with wicked treachery harmed the people and the cities.  For after this, by serving the king with industry, they won him over to themselves and seeing the people moved by a quarrel that touched them closely they were able to subjugate the king; then turning their ferocious arms upon the people they broke faith and killed the princes by a premeditated fraud while they were sitting with them after calling them together to make peace and a treaty with them, and the prince they drove over the top of the snowy mountain.  These are the things I had begun to prophesy to him would happen to the kingdom.  Next roaming abroad they set fire to the houses of the nation, and strove to make everything subject to themselves.  But when Vortimer saw how great was the peril of his country, and saw his father expelled from the hall of Brutus, he took the crown, with the assent of the people, and attacked the savage tribes that were crushing them, and by many battles forced these to return to Thanet where the fleet was that had brought them.  But in their flight fell the warrior Horsus and many others, slain by our men.  The king followed them and, taking his stand before Thanet besieged it by land and sea, but without success, for the enemy suddenly got possession of their fleet and with violence broke out and, led over the sea, they regained their own country in haste.  Therefore, since he had conquered the enemy in victorious war, Vortimer became a ruler to be respected in the world, and he treated his kingdom with just restraint.  But Hengist’s sister, Rowena, 55 seeing with indignation these successes, and protected by deceit, mixed poison, becoming on her brother’s account a malignant step-mother, and she gave it to Vortimer to drink, and killed him by the draught.  At once she sent across the water to her brother to tell him to come back with so many and such great multitudes that he would be able to conquer the warlike natives.  This therefore he did, for he came with such force against our army that he took booty from everybody until he was loaded with it, and he thoroughly destroyed by fire the houses throughout the country.



“While these things were happening Uther and Ambrosius were in Breton territory with King Biducus and they had already girded on their swords and were proved fit for war, and had associated with themselves troops from all directions so that they might seek their native land and put to flight the people who were busy wasting their patrimony.  So they gave their boats to the wind and the sea, and landed for the protection of their subjects; they drove Vortigern through the regions of Wales and shut him up in his tower and burned both him and it.  Then they turned their swords upon the Angles and many times when they met them they defeated them, and on the other hand they were often defeated by them.  At length in a hand to hand conflict our men with great effort attacked the enemy and defeated them decisively, and killed Hengist, and by the will of Christ triumphed.



“After these things had been done, the kingdom and its crown were with the approval of clergy and laity given to Ambrosius, and he ruled justly in all things, but after the space of four [sixteen] years had elapsed he was betrayed by his doctor, and died from drinking poison.  His younger brother Uther succeeded him, and at first was unable to maintain his kingdom in peace, for the perfidious people, accustomed by now to return, came and laid waste everything with their usual phalanx.  Uther fought them in savage battles and drove them conquered across the water with returning oars.  Soon he put aside strife and re-established peace and begat a son who afterwards was so eminent that he was second to none in uprightness.  Arthur was his name and he held the kingdom for many years after the death of his father Uther, and this he did with great grief and labour, and with the slaughter of many men in many wars.  For while the aforesaid chief lay ill, from Anglia came a faithless people who with sword subdued all the country and the regions across the Humber.  Arthur was a boy and on account of his youth he was not able to defeat such a force.  Therefore after seeking the advice of clergy and laity he sent to Hoel, king of Brittany, and asked him to come to his aid with a swift fleet, for they were united by ties of blood and friendship, so that each was bound to relieve the distresses of the other.  Hoel therefore quickly collected for the war fierce men from every side and came to us with many thousands, and joining with Arthur he attacked the enemy often, and drove them back and made terrible slaughter.  With his help Arthur was secure and strong among all the troops when he attacked the enemy whom at length he conquered and forced to return to their own country, and he quieted his own kingdom by the moderation of his laws.



“Soon after this struggle he changed the scene of the war, and subdued the Scots and Irish and all these warlike countries by means of the forces he had brought.  He also subjugated the Norwegians far away across the broad seas, and the Danes whom he had visited with his hated fleet.  He conquered the people of the Gauls after killing Frollo to whom the Roman power had given the care of that country; the Romans, too, who were seeking to make war on his country, he fought against and conquered, and killed the Procurator Hiberius Lucius 56 who was then a colleague of Legnis the general, and who by the command of the Senate had come to bring the territories of the Gauls under their power.  Meanwhile the faithless and foolish custodian Modred had commenced to subdue our kingdom to himself, and was making unlawful love to the king’s wife.  For the king, desiring, as men say, to go across the water to attack the enemy, had entrusted the queen and the kingdom to him.  But when the report of such a great evil came to his ears, he put aside his interest in the wars and, returning home, landed with many thousand men and fought with his nephew and drove him flying across the water.  There the traitor, after collecting Saxons from all sides, began to battle with his lord, but he fell, betrayed by the unholy people confiding in whom he had undertaken such big things.  How great was the slaughter of men and the grief of women whose sons fell in that battle!  After it the king, mortally wounded, left his kingdom and, sailing across the water with you as you have related, came to the court of the maidens.  Each of the two sons of Modred, desiring to conquer the kingdom for himself, began to wage war and each in turn slew those who were near of kin to him.  Then Duke Constantine, nephew of the king, rose up fiercely against them and ravaged the people and the cities, and after having killed both of them by a cruel death ruled over the people and assumed the crown.  But he did not continue in peace since Conan his relative waged dire war on him and ravaged everything and killed the king and seized for himself those lands which he now governs weakly and without a plan.”



While he was speaking thus the servants hurried in and announced to him that a new fountain had broken out at the foot of the mountains and was pouring out pure waters which were running through all the hollow valley and swirling through the fields as they slipped along.  Both therefore quickly rose to see the new fountain, and having seen it Merlin sat down again on the grass and praised the spot and the flowing waters, and marvelled that they had come out of the ground in such a fashion.  Soon afterward, becoming thirsty, he leaned down to the stream and drank freely and bathed his temples in its waves, so that the water passed through the passages of bowels and stomach, settling the vapours within him, and at once he regained his reason and knew himself, and all his madness departed and the sense which had long remained torpid in him revived, and he remained what he had once been - sane and intact with his reason restored. 57  Therefore, praising God, he turned his face toward the stars and uttered devout words of praise.  “O King, through whom the machine of the starry heavens exists, through whom the sea and the land with its pleasing grass give forth and nourish their offspring and with their profuse fertility give frequent aid to mankind, through whom sense has returned and the error of my mind has vanished!  I was carried away from myself and like a spirit I knew the acts of past peoples and predicted the future.  Then since I knew the secrets of things and the flight of birds and the wandering motions of the stars and the gliding of the fishes, all this vexed me and denied a natural rest to my human mind by a severe law.  Now I have come to myself and I seem to be moved with a vigour such as was wont to animate my limbs.  Therefore, highest Father, ought I to be obedient to Thee, that I may show forth Thy most worthy praise from a worthy heart, always joyfully making joyful offerings.  For twice Thy generous hand has benefited me alone, in giving me the gift of this new fountain out of the green grass.  For now I have the water which hitherto I lacked, and by drinking of it my brains have been made whole.  But whence comes this virtue, O dear companion, that this new fountain breaks out thus, and makes me myself again who up to now was as though insane and beside myself?”



Taliesin answered, “The opulent Regulator of things divided the rivers according to their kinds, and added moreover to each a power of its own, that they might often prove of benefit to the sick. 58  For there are fountains and rivers and lakes throughout the world which by their power cure many, and often do so.  At Rome, for instance, flows swift Albula, with its health-giving stream which men say cures wounds with its sure healing.  There is another fountain, called Cicero’s, which flows in Italy, which cures the eyes of all injuries.  The Ethiopians also are said to have a pool which makes a face on which it is poured shine just as though from oil.  Africa has a fountain, commonly called Zama, a drink from it produces melodious voices by its sudden power.  Lake Clitorius in Italy gives a distaste for wine; those who drink from the fountain of Chios are said to become dull.  The land of Boeotia is said to have two fountains; the one makes the drinker forgetful, the other makes them remember.  The same country contains a lake so harmful with its dire plague that it generates madness and the heat of too much passion.  The fountain of Cyzicus drives away lust and the love of Venus.  In the region of Campania there flow, it is said, rivers which when drunk of make the barren fruitful, and the same ones are said to take away madness from men.  The land of the Ethiopians contains a fountain with a red stream; whoever drinks of this will come back demented.  The fountain of Leinus never permits miscarriages.  There are two fountains in Sicily, one of which makes girls sterile and the other makes them fruitful by its kindly law.  There are two rivers in Thessaly of the greatest power; a sheep drinking of one turns black and is made white by the other, and any one drinking of both spends its life with a variegated fleece.  There is a lake called Clitumnus in the Umbrian land which is said at times to produce large oxen, and in the Reatine Swamp the hooves of horses become hard as soon as they cross its sands.  In the Asphalt Lake of Judaea bodies can never sink while life animates them, but on the other hand the land of India has a pool called Sida in which nothing floats but sinks at once to the bottom.  And there is a Lake Aloe in which nothing sinks but all things float even if they are pieces of lead.  The fountain of Marsida also compels stones to float.  The River Styx flows from a rock and kills those who drink of it; the land of Arcadia bears testimony to this form of destruction.  The fountain of Idumea, changing four times throughout the days, is said to vary its colour by a strange rule; for it becomes muddy, then green, then the order changes and it turns red and then becomes clear with a beautiful stream.  It is said to retain each of these colours for three months as the years roll around.  There is also a Lake Trogdytus whose waves flow out, three times in the day bitter, and three times sweet with a pleasant taste.  From a fountain of Epirus torches are said to be lighted, and if extinguished to resume their light again.  The fountain of the Garamantes is said to be so cold in the day time, and on the other hand so hot all night, that it forbids approach on account of its cold or its heat.  There are also hot waters that threaten many because of the heat which they get when they flow through alum or sulphur which have a fiery power, pleasant for healing.  God endowed the rivers with these powers and others so that they might be the means of quick healing for the sick, and so that they might make manifest with what power the Creator stands eminent among things while He works thus in them.  I think that these waters are healthful in the highest degree and I think that they could afford a quick cure through the water that has thus broken out.  They have up to now been flowing about through the dark hollows under the earth like many others that are said to trickle underground.  Perhaps their breaking out is due to an obstacle getting in their way, or to the slipping of a stone or a mass of earth.  I think that, in making their way back again, they have gradually penetrated the ground and have given us this fountain.  You see many such flow along and return again underground and regain their caverns.”



While they were doing these things a rumour ran all about that a new fountain had broken out in the woods of Calidon, and that drinking from it had cured a man who had for a long time been suffering from madness and had lived in these same woods after the manner of the wild beasts.  Soon therefore the princes and the chieftains came to see it and to rejoice with the prophet who had been cured by the water.  After they had informed him in detail of the status of his country and had asked him to resume his sceptre, and to deal with his people with his accustomed moderation, he said, “Young men, my time of life, drawing on toward old age, and so possessing my limbs that with my weakened vigour I can scarce pass through the fields, does not ask this of me.  I have already lived long enough, rejoicing in happy days while an abundance of great riches smiled profusely upon me.  In that wood there stands an oak in its hoary strength which old age, that consumes everything, has so wasted away that it lacks sap and is decaying inwardly. 58bis  I saw this when it first began to grow and I even saw the fall of the acorn from which it came, and a woodpecker standing over it and watching the branch.  Here I have seen it grow of its won accord, watching it all, and, fearing for it in these fields, I marked the spot with my retentive mind.  So you see I have lived a long time and now the weight of age holds me back and I refuse to reign again.  When I remain under the green leaves the riches of Calidon delight me more than the gems that India produces, or the gold that Tagus is aid to have on its shore, more than the crops of Sicily or the grapes of pleasant Methis, more than lofty turrets or cities girded with high walls or robes fragrant with Tyrian perfumes.  Nothing pleases me enough to tear me away from my Calidon which in my opinion is always pleasant.  Here shall I remain while I live, content with apples and grasses, and I shall purify my body with pious fastings that I may be worthy to partake of the life everlasting.”



While he was speaking thus, the chiefs caught sight of long lines of cranes in the air, circling through space in a curved line in the shape of certain letters; they could be seen in marshalled squadron in the limpid air.  Marvelling at these they asked Merlin to tell why it was that they were flying in such manner.  Merlin presently said to them, “The Creator of the world gave to the birds as to many other things their proper nature, as I have learned by living in the woods for many days.



“It is therefore the nature of the cranes, 59 as they go through the air, if many are present, that we often see them in their flight form a figure in one way or another.  One, by calling, warns them to keep the formation as they fly, lest it break up and depart from the usual figure; when he becomes hoarse another takes his place.  They post sentries at night and the watchman holds a pebble in his claws when he wishes to drive away sleep, and when they see any one they start up with a sudden clamour.  The feathers of all of them grow black as they grow older.  But the eagles, who get their name from the sharpness of their sight, are said to be of such keen vision, beyond all others, that they are able to gaze at the sun without flinching.  They hang up their young in its rays wishing to know by his avoidance of them whether their exists among them one of inferior breeding.  They remain on their wings over waters as high as the top of a mountain and they spy their prey in the lowest depths; straightway they descend rapidly through the void and seize the fish swimming as their inheritance demands.  The vulture, thinking little of the commerce of the sexes, often conceives and bears (strange to say) without any seed of her spouse.  Flying about on high in the manner of the eagle she scents with distended nostrils a dead body far across the water.  This she has no horror of approaching in her flight, although she is slow, so that she may satiate herself with the prey she wishes for.  This same bird also lives vigorous for a hundred years.  The stork with its croaking voice is a messenger of spring; it is said to nourish its young so carefully that it takes out its own feathers and denudes its own breast.  When winter comes men say it avoids the storms and approaches the shores of Asia, led by a crow.  Its young feed it as it grows old because it fed them when it owed them this care.  The swan, a bird most pleasing to sailors, excels all others in the sweetness of its music when it dies.  Men say that in the country of the Hyperboreans it comes up close by being attracted by the sound of a zither played loudly along the shore.  The ostrich deserts her eggs which she places under the dust that they may be taken care of there when she herself neglects them.  Thence the birds come into the world hatched by the sun instead of their mother.  The heron, when it fears the rain and the tempests, flies to the clouds to avoid such a peril; hence sailors say that it portends sudden rainstorms when they see it high up in the air.  The phoenix by divine dispensation always lives as an unique bird, and in the land of the Arabs rises with a renewed body.  When it grows old it goes to a place very warm from the heat of the sun and gets together a great heap of spices and builds itself a pyre, which it lights with rapid movements of its wings, and it settles down upon this and is completely consumed.  The ashes of its body produce a bird, and in this way the phoenix is again renewed throughout the ages.  The cinnamolgus when it wishes to build a nest brings cinnamon, and builds of that because of its undoubted strength.  From this men are in the habit of driving it away with arrows, after which they remove the heap and sell it.  The halcyon is a bird that frequents sea pools and builds its nest in time of winter; when it broods the seas are calm for seven days and the winds cease and the tempests, relaxed, hold off, furnishing placid quiet for the bird.  The parrot is thought to utter human speech as its own call when no one is looking directly at it, and it mixes “ave” and “chaire” with jocose words.  The pelican is a bird accustomed to kill its young and to lament for three days confused with grief.  Then it tears its own body with its beak and, cutting the veins, lets out streams of blood with which it sprinkles the birds and brings them back to life.  The Diomedae when they resound with tearful noise and make lament are said to portend the sudden death of kings or a great peril to the realm.  And when they see anyone they know at once what he is, whether barbarian or Greek; for they approach a Greek with beatings of the wings and with caresses and they make a joyful noise but they fly about the others on hostile wings and approach them with a horrible sound as though they were enemies.  The Memnonides are said to go on a long flight every fifth year to the tomb of Memnon, and to lament the prince killed in the Trojan war.  The shining Hercynia has a marvellous feather which gleams on a dark night like a lighted lamp, and shows the way if it is carried in front of a traveller.  When the woodpecker makes a nest he pulls out of the tree nails and wedges that no one else can get out and the whole neighbourhood resounds with his blows.”



After he had finished speaking a certain madman came to them, either by accident or led there by fate; 60 he filled the grove and the air with a terrific clamour and like a wild boar he foamed at the mouth and threatened to attack them.  They quickly captured him and made him sit down by them that his remarks might move them to laughter and jokes.  When the prophet looked at him more attentively he recollected who he was and groaned from the bottom of his heart, saying, “This is not the way he used to look when we were in the bloom of our youth, for at that time he was a fair, strong knight and one distinguished by his nobility and his royal race.  Him and many others I had with me in the days of my wealth, and I was thought fortunate in having so many good companions, and I was.  It happened one time while we were hunting in the lofty mountains of Arwystli 61 that we came to an oak which rose in the air with its broad branches.  A fountain flowed there, surrounded on all sides by green grass, whose waters were suitable for human consumption; we were all thirsty and we sat down by it and drank greedily of its pure waters.  Then we saw some fragrant apples lying on the tender grass of the familiar bank of the fountain.  The man who saw them first quickly gathered them up and gave them to me, laughing at the unexpected gift.  I distributed to my companions the apples he had given to me, and I went without any because the pile was not big enough.  The others to whom the apples had been given laughed and called me generous, and eagerly attacked and devoured them and complained because there were so few of them.  Without any delay a miserable sadness seized this man and all the others; they quickly lost their reason and like dogs bit and tore each other, and foamed at the mouth and rolled on the ground in a demented state.  Finally, they went away like wolves filling the vacant air with howlings.  These apples I thought were intended for me and not for them, and later I found out that they were.  At that time there was in that district a woman who had formerly been infatuated with me, and had satisfied her love for me during many years.  After I had spurned her and had refused to cohabit with her she was suddenly seized with an evil desire to do me harm, and when with all her plotting she could not find any means of approach, she placed the gifts smeared with poison by the fountain to which I was going to return, planning by this device to injure me if I should chance to find the apples on the grass and eat them.  But my good fortune kept me from them, as I have just said.  I pray you, make this man drink of the healthful waters of this new fountain so that, if by chance he get back his health, he may know himself and may, while his life lasts, labour with me in these glades in service to God.”  This, therefore, the leaders did, and the man who had come there raging drank the water, recovered, and, cured at once recognized his friends.



Then Merlin said, “You must now go on in the service of God who restored you as you now see yourself, you who for so many years lived in the desert like a wild beast, going about without a sense of shame.  Now that you have recovered your reason, do not shun the bushes or the green glades which you inhabited while you were mad, but stay with me that you may strive to make up in service to God for the days that the force of madness took from you.  From now on all things shall be in common between you and me in this service so long as either lives.”  At this Maeldinus (for that was the man’s name) said, “Reverend father, I do not refuse to do this, for I shall joyfully stay in the woods with you, and shall worship God with my whole mind, while that spirit, for which I shall render thanks to your ministry, governs my trembling limbs.”  “And I shall make a third with you, and shall despise the things of the world,” said Taliesin.  “I have spent enough time living in vain, and now is the time to restore me to myself under your leadership.  But you, lords, go away and defend your cities; it is not fitting that you should disturb beyond measure our quiet with your talk.  You have applauded my friend enough.”



The chiefs went away, and the three remained, with Ganieda, the prophet’s sister, making a fourth, she who at length had assumed and was leading a seemly life after the death of the king who so recently had ruled so many people by the laws he administered.  Now with her brother there was nothing more pleasant to her than the woods.  She too was at times elevated by the spirit so that she often prophesied to her friends concerning the future of the kingdom.  Thus on a certain day when she stood in her brother’s hall and saw the windows of the house shining with the sun she uttered these doubtful words from her doubtful breast.



“I see the city of Oxford filled with helmed men, 62 and the holy men and the holy bishops bound in fetters by the advice of the Council, and men shall admire the shepherd’s tower reared on high, and he shall be forced to open it to no purpose and to his own injury.  I see Lincoln 63 walled in by savage soldiery and two men shut up in it, one of whom escapes to return with a savage tribe and their chief to the walls to conquer the cruel soldiers after capturing their leader.  O what a shame it is that the stars should capture the sun, under whom they sink down, compelled neither by force nor by war!  I see two moons in the air near Winchester 64 and two lions acting with too great ferocity, and one man looking at two and another at the same number, and preparing for battle and standing opposed.  The others rise up and attack the fourth fiercely and savagely but not one of them prevails, for he stands firm and moves his shield and fights back with his weapons and as victor straightway defeats his triple enemy.  Two of them he drives across the frozen regions of the north while he gives to the third the mercy that he asks, so that the stars flee through all portions of the fields.  The Boar of Brittany, protected by an aged oak, takes away the moon, brandishing swords behind her back.  I see two stars engaging in combat with wild beasts beneath the hill of Urien where the people of Gwent and those of Deira met in the reign of the great Coel. 65  O with what sweat the men drip and with what blood the ground while wounds are being given to the foreigners!  One star collides with the other and falls into the shadow, hiding its light from the renewed light.  Alas what dire famine shall come, so that the north shall inflame her vitals and empty them of the strength of her people.  It begins with the Welsh and goes through the chief parts of the kingdom, and forces the wretched people to cross the water.  The calves accustomed to live on the milk of the Scottish cows that are dying from the pestilence shall flee.  Normans depart and cease to bear weapons through our native realm with your cruel soldiery.  There is nothing left with which to feed your greed for you have consumed everything that creative nature has produced in her happy fertility.  Christ, aid thy people! restrain the lions and give to the country quiet peace and the cessation of wars.”  She did not stop with this and her companions wondered at her, and her brother, who soon came to her, spoke approvingly with friendly words in this manner, “Sister, does the spirit wish you to foretell future things, since he has closed up my mouth and my book?  Therefore this task is given to you; rejoice in it, and under my favour devoted to him speak everything.”



I have brought this song to an end.  Therefore, ye Britons, give a wreath to Geoffrey of Monmouth.  He is indeed yours for once he sang of your battles and those of your chiefs, and he wrote a book called “The Deeds of the Britons” which are celebrated throughout the world.

EXT. CITYSCAPE - NIGHT

Gotham City.  The City of Tomorrow:  stark angles,
creeping shadows, dense, crowded, as if hell had erupted
through the sidewalks.  A dangling fat moon shines
overhead.

EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - NIGHT

PUSHERS wave to HOOKERS.  STREET HUSTLERS slap high-fives
with three-card monte dealers.  They all seem to know
each other... with one conspicuous exception:

A TOURIST FAMILY, MOM, DAD, AND LITTLE JIMMY, march
warily down the main drag.  Just out of a show.  But the
respectable theatre crowd has thinned out, and now --
Playbills in hand -- they're on Gotham's meanest street.

		MOM
	For God's sake, Harold, can we
	please just get a taxi??

		DAD
	I'm trying to get a --
		(shouting)
	TAXI!!
Three cabs streak pass and disappear.  Jimmy reads map.

		JIMMY
	We're going the wrong way.

Nearby, STREET TYPES are beginning to snicker.

		DAD
	Put that AWAY.  We'll look like
	tourists.

TWO COPS lean on their patrol car outside an all-night
souvlaki stand, sipping coffee and chatting with a
HOOKER.

The HOOKER smiles at Jimmy.  Jimmy smiles back.  Mom
yanks him off down the street and glowers at Dad.

		DAD
	We'll never get a cab.  Let's cut
	over to Seventh.

		JIMMY
	Seventh is that way.

		DAD
	I know where we are!
EXT. SIDE STREET - NIGHT (THAT MOMENT)

Deserted street lined with stripped-down cars.  Family
marches into the darkness.

		VOICE
	Hey, mister.  Gimme a dollar?

A DERELICT -- nineteen or twenty, acne-scarred -- his
ratty T-shirt -- ""I LOVE GOTHAM CITY"" -- family moves on,
pretending not to hear.

		DERELICT
	Mister.  How about it.  One dollar?
		(standing up)
	Are you deaf?  -- Do you speak
	English??

TOURISTS cross street.  DERELICT doesn't follow.

Their pace quickens.  A SHADOWY FIGURE in the alleyway.
A GLOVED HAND slams a GUN across Dad's neck.

He crumples.  Mom grabs Jimmy and backs up against a
brick wall, too terrified to scream.  The DERELICT races
across the street to join his confederate, the STREET
PUNK, who's already searching for Dad's wallet.
Mom's ready to snap -- STREET PUNK trains his gun on
Jimmy.

		STREET PUNK
	Do the kid a favor, lady.  Don't
	scream.

TEARS stream down her face.  She stifles a scream and
clutches Jimmy.  He's paralyzed with fear.

The two PUNKS CHUCKLE and race away.

Mom's self-control disintegrates -- she begins to SCREAM
before moving to unconscious Dad.  SCREAM ECHOES.

EXT. CATHEDRAL - NIGHT

A darkly ornate Gothic anomaly:  old City Cathedral, once
grand, long since boarded up.

STONE GARGOYLES gaze down from their shadowy rooftops.

Mom's SCREAM (uninterrupted from the previous scene)
ECHOES up.  And one of the GARGOYLES MOVES.

EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT

Six stories up.

The PUNKS -- NICK and EDDIE -- hunker down on the tar-
and-gravel roof, sizing up their take.

		NICK
	All RIGHT.  American Express.
		(tossing the credit
		 card at Eddie)
	Don't leave home without it.

A chill wind BLOWS as Nick counts cash.  There's a
distant, metallic CLANG; EDDIE hears it and tenses up.

		EDDIE
	Let's beat it, man.  I don't like
	it up here.

		NICK
	What are ya, scared of heights?

		EDDIE
	I dunno.  After what happened to
	Johnny Gobs --

		NICK
	Look, Johnny Gobs got ripped and
	walked off a roof, all right?  No
	big loss.

		EDDIE
	No, man.  That ain't what I heard
	at all.
		(beat)
	I heard the BAT got him.

		NICK
	The BAT?!  Gimme a break, will
	you, Eddie?

		EDDIE
	Five stories, straight down.
	There was no blood in the body.

		NICK
	No shit.  It was all over the
	pavement.

ANOTHER SOUND.  Now even Nick can't ignore the slight
tingle at the base of his spine...

		NICK
	Shut up.
		(conclusively)
	There ain't no bat.

At the opposite corner of the roof, some fifteen yards
away... at the end of a line, a STRANGE BLACK SILHOUETTE
is dropping slowly, implacably, into frame...

		EDDIE
	You shouldn'ta turned the gun on
	that kid, man.  You shouldn'ta --

		NICK
	You want your cut of this money or
	don't you?  Now shut up!  Shut
	up --

BOTH PUNKS FREEZE at the sudden, inexplicable sound of
BOOTS CRUNCHING ON GRAVEL.  They turn slowly.  Their
JAWS DROP.

At the edge of the roof, bathed in moonlight, is a BLACK
APPARITION.

Eddie freezes, a choked GURGLE in his throat.  The BLACK
FIGURE advances and spreads its arms, slowly, majes-
tically.  GREAT SHADOWY WINGS flap in the wind.

On its chest is THE EMBLEM OF A BAT, in an oval yellow
field, glowing like a target in the darkness..

Nick drops to the gravel, grabs the GUN, and FIRES TWICE.
TWO CLEAN HITS.  The strange black figure is knocked
bodily to the roof.

		NICK
	-- I'm gettin' outta here.

He bends to retrieve his loot.  Eddie lets out AN ODD,
PRE-VERBAL SQUEAL...

... and NICK sees THE HUMAN BAT, BACK ON ITS FEET, NIGHT-
MARISH, UNDEAD, MOVING SLOWLY AND INEVITABLY CLOSER.

Panic.  Stolen money flutters out of Nick's hands.  He
SCUTTLES FRANTICALLY across the roof.  The BLACK SPECTRE
is blocking his path to the fire escape.  Trapped like a
rat, Nick FIRES WILDLY.

Eddie's face is pale.  The BAT treads calmly past.  A LEG
snakes out.  A BLACK BOOT catches Eddie high on the chest
-- LIFTS HIM CLEANLY OFF HIS FEET -- AND SENDS HIM FLYING
THROUGH THE AIR.  Eddie slams into a brick chimney and
slumps unconscious.

THE BAT DOESN'T EVEN BREAK HIS STRIDE.  Nick CHARGES past
the black wraith, toward the fire escape...

A GLOVED HAND slices through the air, and Nick pitches
forward, his legs ensnared in a tangle of WIRES.  SCREAM-
ING, he drags himself across the gravel roof, the BAT at
his heels... 'til there's no place left to go.  Nick
cowers on the edge.

Nick keeps SHOOTING.  Eyes closed.  Hammer falls on an
empty chamber, but Nick still pulls the trigger.  He
MOANS.

BAT grabs Nick by the shirt, HOISTS HIM into the air.

		NICK
	Don't kill me... don't kill me...

Nick opens his eyes... the BAT is standing on the ledge
of the roof -- HOLDING HIM OUT, at arm's length, over six
stories of nothingness.  A rasping VOICE.

		BATMAN
	You're trespassing, Ratbreath.

Nick looks down.  Far, far below, CARS wink silently past.

He looks up.  And sees, in the mirrored lenses where
Batman's eyes should be, the twin reflections of his own
stricken face.

		NICK
	Trespassing?  You don't own the
	night.

		BATMAN
	Tell your friends.  Tell all your
	friends.  I AM the night.

Nick HOWLS.  Batman heaves him roughly back onto the tar-
and-gravel surface of the roof.  And then -- casually,
without a moment's hesitation -- steps off the ledge,
into midair.

Trembling, Nick crawls to the ledge and looks over...
finding ABSOLUTELY NO TRACE of the Batman.

Nick is still SCREAMING as we PAN UP TO Gotham's moon.

INT. GOTHAM CITY DEMOCRATS' CLUB - NIGHT

A VICTORY POSTER fills one wall:  ""CONGRATULATIONS!  A
NEW GOTHAM CITY!  HARVEY DENT - DISTRICT ATTORNEY.""

MAYOR BORG, hysterical and self-certain introduces the
new District Attorney, HARVEY DENT -- a young, determined
lawyer.

		MAYOR BORG
	Across this nation, the words
	'Gotham City' are synonymous with
	crime.  Our streets are overrun,
	and our police officials have been
	helpless.  As Mayor I promised you
	that I would root out the source
	of corruption at the root!  Boss
	Carl Grissom!  Our new District
	Attorney Harvey Dent will carry
	out that promise.  I promise.

APPLAUSE.  DENT stands to speak.  We SEE a SINGLE EMPTY
PLACE SETTING at the end of the table -- and an engraved
placecard which bears the name ""BRUCE WAYNE.""

		DENT
	I'm a man of few words.  But those
	words will count.  And so will our
	actions.  I have talked today to
	Police Commissioner Gordon.

ANGLE ON JAMES W. GORDON

Gotham's police commissioner, a distinguished gent in
his late fifties.

		DENT
	He is targeting businesses
	suspected of fronting for the
	syndicate in this city.  Within
	one week we'll knock down their
	doors and shed the light of the
	law on that nest of vipers.

INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

A woman's apartment, sparsely furnished but tasteless.
Modern chairs and coffee table in front of a TV set.
High-fashion magazine picture blow-ups all modeled by
the same girl on walls.

In the foreground:  a MAN'S HAND, long, elegant, and
manicured, manipulates a DECK OF CARDS, doing a one-
handed shuffle with extraordinary finesse.

The TV news has highlights of HARVEY DENT's victory
speech.

		DENT (V.O.)
		(on the TV screen)
	Together we can make this city
	safe for decent people --

THE HAND sets the deck on a table, turns up FOUR JACKS
off the top.  This most unusual deck sports a .22 calibre
BULLET HOLE straight through the middle.

		JACK NAPIER
	Decent people shouldn't live here.
	They'd be happier someplace else.

JACK NAPIER is right-hand man and chief enforcer to
BOSS CARL GRISSOM.

He is tough, vain, takes great pride in his appearance,
and is not reconciled to no longer being twenty one.
Velvet Death.  ALICIA HUNT -- CARL GRISSOM's woman --
glides over in her negligee.  Jack has his feet on the
table, resting on a copy of Vogue on the cover of which
is a picture of Alicia.  She lifts his feet and rescues
the magazine.  She is young, very beautiful, and as
narcissistic as Jack.  She's the model pictured on the
walls.

		ALICIA
	Pretty tough talk about Carl.

		JACK
	Don't worry about it.  It this
	clown could tough Grissom... I'd
	have killed him by now.

Alicia knots Jack's loose tie playfully about his neck.

		ALICIA
	If Grissom knew about us... he
	might kill you.

Jack's eye darts back and forth between the TV and his
own reflection in a nearby vanity.  Not interested in
her.

		JACK
	Don't flatter yourself, angel.
	He's a tired old man.  He can't
	run this city without me.
		(pause)
	And besides, he doesn't know.

Jack remotes OFF the TV.

		ALICIA
	You don't worry about anything,
	do you, Jack?

Jack gives Alicia a disdainful look, consults his watch,
reaches for his topcoat, and stands in front of the
vanity.  He runs a hand through sculpted hair, checks his
fine threads.

		ALICIA
	You look fine.

He smiles at himself before turning to the door.

		JACK
	... I didn't ask.

EXT. ALLEYWAY - NIGHT

The scene of the earlier mugging is now ABUZZ with police
cars, an ambulance, a forensics van.

Eddie goes past on a stretcher, catatonic.  Watching him
are a POLICE MEDIC and a porcine cop, LT. ECKHARDT, who
jots on a notepad.

		ECKHARDT
	No, let me guess.  A gigantic,
	menacing, supernatural form... in
	the shape of a bat.

		MEDIC
	That's it... What are they SEEING
	up there?

		ECKHARDT
	They're all drinkin' Drano.

		MEDIC
	It's still weird, Lieutenant.

		ECKHARDT
		(under his breath)
	Oh Christ, Knox!

At the mouth of the alley is ALEXANDER KNOX, 30, a crime
reporter for the Gotham Globe.

		KNOX
	Hiya, gents.  I hear we got
	another bat attack.
	That's eight 'sightings' now in
	just under a month.  I hear the
	Commissioner's opened a file.

		ECKHARDT
	Sorry, Knox.  These two slipped
	on a banana peel.

Two uniformed PATROLMEN drag a brain-fried Nick past.

		NICK
	A bat, I tell you, a GIANT bat!
	He wanted me to do him a favor...!

Knox smirks.  Eckhardt and the Medic trade disgusted
looks.

		ECKHARDT
		(irritated)
	Don't be writing this crap in the
	newspaper, Knox, it'll ruin your
	already useless reputation.

		KNOX
	Lieutenant.  Lotsa punks in town're
	scared stiff!  They say he drinks
	blood.  They say he can't be killed.

		ECKHARDT
	I say you're full of shit, Knox.

Eckhardt turns away in annoyance.

		ECKHARDT
	And you can quote me on that!

		KNOX
	Lieutenant.  Is there a six-foot
	bat in Gotham City?
		(shouting)
	If so, is he on the police payroll?
	If so, what's he pulling down
	after taxes?

EXT. STREET - NIGHT (THAT MOMENT)

Eckhardt emerges onto the side street -- and spies a
STRETCH LIMO IDLING nearby.  Leaning on the hood, waving
hi, is the dandyish Jack NAPIER.  Jack's odd driver BOB
HAWKINS polishes the door handle.

Jack swaggers up and tosses Eckhardt a sandwich bag.

		JACK
	I brought you a little snack,
	Eckhardt.

Eckhardt looks at the sandwich inside.  It's full of 100
DOLLAR BILLS.  The cop throws a nervous glance back in
KNOX's direction and stuffs it quickly in his coat.

		ECKHARDT
	Why don't you broadcast it, Napier?

		JACK
	Shut up and listen -- Harvey Dent
	is sniffing around one of our
	companies.

Eckhardt bristles.

		ECKHARDT
		(testy)
	That's my territory, Jack.  If
	there's a problem --

Suddenly, Jack grabs Eckhardt by the lapels of his
topcoat.

		JACK
	Eckhardt... your problems are our
	problems.

		ECKHARDT
		(knocking his hands
		 away)
	I answer to Grissom, not to
	Psychos.

		JACK
	Why, Eckhardt.  You should be
	thinking about the future.

		ECKHARDT
		(sneers)
	You mean... when you run the show?
	You got no future, Jack.  You're
	an A-1 nut boy and Grissom knows
	it.

Jack claps a hand on Eckhardt's face and shoves him full-
force into a wall.  Stunned, Eckhardt turns bright red
and grabs Jack by the coat collar and whips out his gun.

Jack calmly takes his hand from Eckhardt's face as the
latter brings the gun up.

		JACK
		(relaxed)
	Watch the suit.

Breathing heavily, Eckhardt lets go of Jack's coat and
lowers the gun.

		JACK
		(smiles)
	See.  You can make a good decision
	when you try.

Jack LAUGHS insanely in Eckhardt's ashen face, EXITS.
When Jack is out of earshot, Eckhardt MUTTERS
menacingly:

		ECKHARDT
	And where you been spending your
	nights, handsome...?

						DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. GOTHAM CITY SQUARE - DAY

Hard-hatted Dent and Gordon follow Mayor across the
construction-filled square.  Preparations are being made
for a gigantic public event.  Banner goes up saying
""200TH ANNIVERSARY OF GOTHAM CITY FESTIVAL.""

		MAYOR
	I don't care how much in debt this
	festival is.  I want a parade, hot
	dogs, balloons, the whole schmeer.
	We're gonna celebrate this 200th
	anniversary proudly.  And PUBLICLY.

		DENT
	We may be celebrating it in
	bankruptcy court.  The tax base
	is crumbling, and if this festival
	crashes you can kiss our bond
	rating goodbye.  The Festival is
	$350,000 in the red and we haven't
	seen one balloon.

		MAYOR
	I'll take care of the festival
	budget.  I've got a party of rich
	old ladies who'll pay $1000 to see
	the inside of Wayne Manor.  You
	fill this square with people, kids,
	dogs, families, and the businesses
	will come back here.

		GORDON
	I think a lot of people might stay
	away, Mayor.  They're scared.

		MAYOR
	They won't be scared when you've
	got Grissom in that courthouse.  I
	promised that, right?

Gordon nods as Mayor marches across the square.

INT. GOTHAM GLOBE - CITY ROOM - DAY

Gotham's leading tabloid daily.  KNOX RUSHES IN, spots
BOB THE CARTOONIST at his drafting table, with several
amused REPORTERS looking on.

		REPORTER
	Well, well.  Count Dracula!  You
	seen Bigfoot lately?

		ANOTHER REPORTER
	They BURIED your story on the
	Batman.

		REPORTER
	They bury garbage.

		KNOX
	This is the Pulitzer prize zone,
	boys!  You wait!

		BOB
	Oh, Knox -- I got something for
	you.

BOB holds up a drawing of a HUMAN BAT, with an awful,
fanged rodent's face, wearing a business suit.  The cap-
tion reads:  ""HAVE YOU SEEN THIS MAN?""

The REPORTERS CRACK up.  Knox, who's used to the ribbing,
mumbles.

		KNOX
	Very nice, boys.  A little more
	gore on the fangs.
		(under his breath)
	What a dick...

He moves on

INT. KNOX'S OFFICE - DAY

Knox approaches but stops in his tracks.

Propped up on the desk are a PAIR OF EXCEPTIONAL LEGS.
Knox stares.  He takes her in -- the most beautiful woman
he's ever seen is attached to the legs.  Leaning back in
Knox's swivel chair, reading the Globe.  Her face
obscured by a big outrageous HAT.  He ENTERS.

		KNOX
	Hel-lo, legs.

The hat tips back.  VICKI VALE, her face framed by a
shock of bright red hair, flashes a dazzling smile.

		VICKI
	I'm reading your stuff.

		KNOX
	And I'm reading yours.

He looks at the oversized CAMERA BAG with decals all over
it.  Monogrammed ""V.V.""  She stands, shakes hands.

		VICKI
	Hi, I'm Vicki Vale.

Her attitude is strong, hip, professional.

		KNOX
	Vicki Vale... Vicki Vale... Let's
	see... Vogue, Cosmo... I've seen
	your stuff.  Listen, you didn't
	come here to ask me to pose nude,
	because you're going to need a
	long lens.

		VICKI
	Actually I've been in Corto
	Maltese.

She pulls out a sheet of COMBAT PHOTOS -- exploding Jeeps,
burning huts, bodies in piles.  A bloody revolution.

		KNOX
	Hey , a girl could get hurt doing
	this.

Knox is impressed but he's also smitten:

		KNOX
		(amazed)
	What are you doing here?

		VICKI
	I'm here to see some of the
	wildlife in Gotham City.

		KNOX
	Wildlife... like what?

		VICKI
	Like -- bats.

She indicates his desk which is littered with doodles of
bats.

		KNOX
		(disbelieving)
	Who sent you?

		VICKI
	No one.  I read your piece.
	There's something about this
	that's very interesting to me.

		KNOX
	What's your angle?

		VICKI
	A picture of a guy in a bat suit
	catching criminals?
		(her hand sweeping
		 a headline)
	BATMAN SWEEPS CRIME FROM GOTHAM.
	My pictures.  Your words.  This
	is Pulitzer prize material.

		KNOX
		(exhilarated)
	You're a visionary.  Problem is,
	you're the only one who believes
	me.  I need something tangible.
	Gordon's got a file on this but I
	can't get him on the phone.

A sly look crosses Vicki's face.

		VICKI
	He'll be at Bruce Wayne's benefit,
	won't he?

		KNOX
	I don't seem to be on the guest
	list.

Sulking, he doesn't notice Vicki reaching into her camera
bag.  He doesn't see the small white INVITATION until she
DANGLES IT right in front of his nose.

		KNOX
	Miss Vale... Got a date?

She flutters her great big eyelashes and shakes her head
no.

		VICKI
	Will you help me?

		KNOX
	Yes.  Will you marry me?

		VICKI
	Perhaps.  Do you snore?

She LAUGHS.  He offers her his arm.

		KNOX
	I'll learn.

						CUT TO:

INT. PENTHOUSE - NIGHT

A HUGE PLATE GLASS WINDOW on the best view in Gotham.
CARL GRISSOM, criminal kingpin, is 50, utterly without
charm.

His LIEUTENANTS -- bloodless white-collar types as well
as a few outright GOONS -- are sprawled nearby in easy
chairs.  Grissom waves a copy of the Globe -- with HARVEY
DENT staring out from page one.

		GRISSOM
	Say this son of a bitch makes a
	connection with us and Axis
	Chemicals, what kind of damage are
	we looking at?

		ACCOUNTANT
	If he ties us in with Axis Chemical,
	we're dead and buried.
		(clearing his throat)
	We should move immediately.

Jack slouches in an easy chair doing his one-handed
shuffle.

		JACK
	Let's just break-in, trash the
	office, make off with the books...
	and call it 'industrial espionage.'

		GRISSOM
	Smart thinking, Jack.
	That's the way to go.  In fact --
	I'd like you to handle this
	operation personally.

Jack's hand FREEZES over his lucky deck.  Nervously, he
turns a card off the top.  It's not a jack; it's a Joker
-- a Joker with a neat, round, .22 calibre HOLE through
its face.

At this exact moment, METAL DOORS slide back -- and
ALICIA HUNT steps out of GRISSOM's private elevator with
an armful of SHOPPING BAGS.

		GRISSOM
	Hello, sweetheart.  I wonder if
	you'd mind waiting in the other
	room.

Alicia's gaze meets Jack's nervously as she vanishes
through a side door.  The eye contact is not lost on
Grissom.

		GRISSOM
	Thank you, gentlemen.  That's all
	for now.

Grissom's CRONIES FILE OUT.  Jack, troubled, lingers
behind.  He looks miserable and obviously doesn't want
to go.

		JACK
	Carl, can't we send somebody else?
	The fumes in that place...

		GRISSOM
	Jack, it's an important job -- I
	need someone I can trust.  You're
	my number one guy.
		(beat)
	Now don't forget your lucky deck.

Jack, resigned, pockets the deck and leaves.

		GRISSOM
		(wolfish grin)
	My friend, your luck is just
	about to change.

Alicia APPEARS in the doorway, modeling her new
purchases.

		GRISSOM
		(smiling into phone)
	Get me Lieutenant Eckhardt.

EXT. WAYNE MANOR - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT

A vast, rambling mansion on sixty wooded acres a half-
hour's drive from Gotham.  Out front, a team of
red-jacketed VALETS are parking expensive cars.

INT. BALLROOM - NIGHT

The ballroom is outfitted with roulette wheels for a
CASINO NIGHT.  Gotham's POWER ELITE eagerly throw cash
into Mayor's festival kitty.  Small banner ""SAVE THE
FESTIVAL!""

ANOTHER ANGLE - HANDSOME YOUNG BRUCE WAYNE

enters from the kitchen.  He's a rich, smart guy with a
thousand things on his mind.  But when you think he's not
paying attention -- you're dead wrong.  He doesn't miss
a thing.

A WAITER hands him something to sign.  He signs and the
waiter EXITS.  Left with the pen, he isn't sure what to
do with it.  He looks around and finally decides to put
it in a flowerpot.  Just then ALFRED THE BUTLER, 60s
mannered but with sense of humor, APPEARS and takes it
from him.  Alfred smiles as Bruce continues through the
foyer past --

In his cheap suit, stands Knox -- staring inquisitively
up at the ceiling.

Alfred appears with a tray of champagne glasses.  He,
too, looks up at the ceiling.

		ALFRED
	Can I help you, sir?

		KNOX
	You know if you cut your bath in
	half, you'd have my whole
	apartment.

		ALFRED
	We do have a rather large
	bathroom, sir.


		KNOX
	No, I meant your bath... as in
	TUB.

Knox takes a drink and Alfred MOVES ON.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Alfred stoops to pick up some glasses, the other glasses
on his tray slide.  He's caught a bit.  Vicki catches the
glasses.  Vicki smiles.

		VICKI
	You okay?

		ALFRED
	Yes, thank you.

A small bond has been formed.  Alfred CONTINUES on his
way.  As an afterthought Vicki calls after him.  Stops.
Bruce has been watching.  Vicki turns to him.

		VICKI
	Excuse me... which one of these
	guys is Bruce Wayne?

		BRUCE
		(caught off guard)
	I... I'm not sure.

		VICKI
	Thanks.

		BRUCE
	Uh... yeah.

Vicki WALKS AWAY.   Bruce watches her, very intrigued.

ANGLE ON GORDON

At craps table, blowing into his fist, he rolls dice.
Snake eyes.  He passes the dice as Knox and Vicki PUSH
UP.

		KNOX
	Commissioner Gordon, Mrs. Gordon.
	How nice you look tonight.
		(to Gordon)
	Have you heard this crazy rumor
	that you have opened a file on
	the Batman?  That's not true is
	it?

Knox puts his hands up behind his head and wiggles his
fingers -- like little bat ears.  Gordon GROANS.

		GORDON
	Knox, for the ninth time, there
	is no bat.  If there were, we
	would find him -- we would arrest
	him --

		KNOX
	... find him, arrest him... that's
	what I always hear, Commissioner.
	Be straight with me.

Dent ambles up, claps a hand on Gordon's shoulder.

		DENT
	How's your luck, Jim?

		KNOX
	Mr. Dent.  Commissioner Gordon and
	I were just talking about winged
	vigilantes, what's your stand?

		DENT
	Mr. Knox, we have enough real
	problems in this city without
	worrying about ghosts.

AN OFFICER motions to Gordon, who FOLLOWS HIM into
another room.  Vicki nods at Knox as they slip away to
FOLLOW THEM.

ANGLE ON BRUCE

He watches them.  Especially the beauteous Vicki.

EXT. AXIS CHEMICAL CO. - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT

A NEON SIGN reads:  ""AXIS CHEMICAL.  THE FUTURE IS NOW.""
From the SIGN we PAN TO a METAL SLUICE GATE -- dumping
TONS of CHURNING TOXIC SLUDGE into Gotham's East River.

A PLAIN VAN pulls up.  Jack and GOONS get out.

ANOTHER ANGLE

The SECURITY GUARD in a booth at the entrance to the lot.
One of Jack's BOYS creeps up and takes the GUARD out.
Jack and Goons sneak in.

INT. WAYNE MANOR - ARMORY - NIGHT

Knox and Vicki ENTER looking for Gordon.  No luck.  Knox
goes goggle-eyed at the armory.

		KNOX
		(ironic)
	And here we are in the arsenal.

On the wall hang EXOTIC WEAPONS.  Every arcane implement
of death the human mind has ever devised.  Knox lets out
a low whistle.

		KNOX
	Look at this stuff.  Who is this
	guy?

Bruce ENTERS and stands just behind them.  Vicki sees
him, but having seen him earlier, regards him casually,
like another partygoer.  Bruce listens with interest.

		VICKI
	Strange.  He gives to humanitarian
	causes... And collects all this...

		KNOX
	Probably does it to get chicks.
	They like him for his big charity
	balls.

		VICKI
		(mischievous)
	I think it's his enormous...
	bankroll they go for.

		KNOX
	Hey, the more they've got, the
	less they're worth.

		VICKI
	This guy must be the most worthless
	man in America.

		KNOX
		(pointing to
		 a sword)
	Where'd this come from?

		BRUCE
	It's Japanese.

Knox turns.  Bruce is trying to remember, but is really
watching Vicki.

		KNOX
	How do you know?

		BRUCE
	Because I got it in Japan.

		KNOX
	Who are you?

		BRUCE
	Oh... Bruce Wayne.

		KNOX
		(extending a
		 hand)
	Alexander Knox.

		BRUCE
		(genuine)
	I read (present tense) your work.
	I like it.

		KNOX
	Great.  Give me a grant.

Bruce flips a polite smile at Knox then switches smoothly
to VICKI, who is amused at being had by Bruce.  She
sticks out her hand.

		VICKI
	Vicki Vale.

		BRUCE
	Bruce Wayne.

		VICKI
		(smile and edge)
	... You sure?

		BRUCE
		(smile)
	I've seen your photographs from
	Corto Maltese -- You've got an
	extraordinary eye.

Bruce is charming.  Knox's territorial instincts arouse.

		KNOX
	Some people think she has two.

		VICKI
	This is an amazing house.  I'd
	love to shoot it sometime.

A WINE STEWARD ENTERS.  Vicki and Knox exchange glances.

		STEWARD
	Mr. Wayne, we need to open another
	five cases of the champagne.  Will
	that be allright?

		BRUCE
	Uh -- yes, sure.  Open six.

Steward EXITS. Bruce turns back to catch up with himself.

		BRUCE
		(to Vicki)
	Yes... Will you be staying in
	Gotham for a while?

		VICKI
	I'd like to.  I'm intrigued by
	Alex's giant bat story.

A RICH COUPLE waves at Bruce as they EXIT.  He politely
waves to them.  Then he looks after them like he can't
remember who they are.  Then he does remember.  Then back
to Vicki.

		BRUCE
	Isn't that a little light after a
	war in Corto Maltese?

		VICKI
		(smiling zap)
	Light?  What do YOU do for a
	living?

Alfred appears in the doorway behind them.

		ALFRED
	Sir?  Commissioner Gordon was
	compelled to leave.

		BRUCE
	Thank you, Alfred.

He turns back to Vicki.  Alfred persists.

		ALFRED
	Ahem.  Sir -- very unexpectedly.

		BRUCE
		(getting it)
	Oh, thank you, Alfred.
		(to Vicki)
	I hope you'll excuse me.

Vicki smiles.  A connection has been made.  They both
know it.

		VICKI
	Sure.

Bruce turns to go.  Setting his glass too close to the
edge of the table.  Alfred calls to him.

		ALFRED
	Sir, I think perhaps THIS way.

		BRUCE
	Oh yes... thanks.  Oh, Alfred,
	they need mare wine in the front
	and someone named Mrs. Daly wanted
	a copy of the menu.  Oh, and,
	Alfred.  Give Mr. Knox a grant.

He winks at Knox. And goes the OTHER way out of the
roam. Alfred fluidly sweeps up Bruce's glass and follows
him briskly OUT OF THE ROOM.  Knox is stung and Vicki
transfixed.

		KNOX
	Nice talkin' to ya, Bruce.  Now
	are the rich odd? Yes they are.
		(jealous)
	Helllo?  Vicki?

		VICKI
		(waking up)
	Sorry, I was -- He's comp-lic-ated.

		KNOX
	I said odd.

		VICKI
	Mm.

		KNOX
	Ah -- Well you're not the only fan.
	This guy loves himself.  There're
	mirrors in every roam.

And indeed, the two of them are standing before an
enormous WALL MIRROR, eight feet wide, running from
floor to ceiling.

		KNOX
	Maybe it should be Bruce VAIN.

						CUT TO:

REVERSE ANGLE - THROUGH MIRROR

LOOKING DOWN ON Knox and Vicki THROUGH one-way glass.
Behind the mirror... recording everything that happens in
the room... is a small, silent, state-of-the-art SURVEIL-
LANCE CAMERA.

CLOSEUP - VIDEO MONITOR

showing KNOX and VICKI in the library.  The screen we're
watching is only one in a whole vast bank of video mon-
itors -- a control center showing everything that happens
in the house.  The background is blurry, indistinct... but
we seem to be in the midst of a vast, dark CAVE.

On another screen, GUESTS move backward with exaggerated
speed, as a videotape REWINDS.  At the panel, Bruce Wayne
hits a button -- and watches COMMISSIONER GORDON talking
to a uniformed PATROLMAN.

		PATROLMAN (V.O.)

	cleaning out Axis Chemicals.

	Good Lord, if we could put our
	hands on him we'd have Grissom.
		(obviously agitated)
	Why wasn't I told about this?
	Who's in charge of the --

		PATROLMAN (V.O.)
	Eckhardt, sir.

		GORDON (V.O.)
	Oh my God...

And suddenly Gordon is grabbing for his coat.  The monitor
GOES BLACK.  Bruce is somehow different.  More relaxed.
He stands up.  He gathers himself.  Focuses inwardly in
a way that empowers him.

						CUT TO:

EXT. AXIS CHEMICAL COMPANY - PARKING LOT - NIGHT

POLICE CARS are pulling into the lot.

Eckhardt circulates among his ARMED SWAT TEAM, handing
out Xeroxed copies of a MUG SHEET:  Jack NAPIER, front
and profile.

		ECKHARDT
	Shoot to kill.

INT. AXIS CHEMICAL - FILE ROOM - NIGHT

SPARKS FLY.  A SAFECRACKER, in welder's mask, trains a
blowtorch on the office safe.  Behind him, Jack's HOODS
are at work on the filing cabinets.  Jack stands watch-
ing, squinting through the fumes.  He holds a silk
handkerchief over his nose and mouth.

The SAFECRACKER kills his blowtorch and opens the metal
door of the safe, giving Jack a good look inside:

		SAFECRACKER
	Empty.

JACK shakes his head:  they've been set up.  A SIREN
blares outside.

		JACK
	We've been ratted out here, boys.

INT. AXIS CHEMICAL - THAT MOMENT

Jack and his HOODS duck out of the office, two stories
above the refinery floor, onto a network of ladders and
CATWALKS.

A COP, stationed behind a bank of machinery, shouts out:

		COP
	Freeze!

One of the HOODS OPENS FIRE.  Half of his colleagues dive
back into the office, looking for a rear exit.  The
others take off across the CATWALKS.

INT. FACTORY FLOOR - A MOMENT LATER

COPS SHOOT BACK as the HOODS scatter.  The COPS' bullets
puncture ducts and pipes from which gas and unpleasant
looking liquid begins to leak.

All at once, a CORRUGATED STEEL DOOR rises -- and COM-
MISSIONER GORDON MARCHES IN with a squadron of UNIFORMED
COPS.  He grabs a startled Eckhardt by the shoulder:

		GORDON
	What the hell is going on here?

		ECKHARDT
	Christ, what are you trying to do
	-- blow the collar?

		GORDON
	I'm in charge here.  Not Carl
	Grissom.
		(shouting)
	I WANT HIM TAKEN ALIVE.  I REPEAT
	-- ANY MAN WHO OPENS FIRE ON JACK
	NAPIER WILL ANSWER TO ME!

Eckhardt SLIPS AWAY INTO THE PLANT.  Gordon realizes he's
gone and follows with gun drawn.

ANGLE ON JACK

Down on the floor, racing, THROWING SWITCHES -- anything
to create a diversion.  GIGANTIC MACHINES ROAR to life.
OVERHEAD CHEMICAL TANKS rotate into place above giant
basins and spew out their contents.

COPS an Jack's tail.  He SHOOTS at them AND RUNS.

ANGLE ON CATWALKS

HOODS 3 and 4 scuttle across the elevated walkways,
FIRING at the POLICE and PUNCTURING mare DUCTS, PIPES,
and CONTAINERS, thereby releasing more CHEMICALS.  Their
HEADS TURN at the sound of a sudden CLANG --

-- as BATMAN drops onto the catwalk from above.  For a
moment, they gape.  Then HOOD 4 takes off running; HOOD
3 turns and LEVELS HIS GUN at Batman --

-- who goes to his belt for a miniature SPEAR GUN and
FIRES at HOOD 3... planting a BARBED HOOK in the HOOD'S
JACKET, SPINNING HIM AROUND.  HOOD 3 drops his gun, slips,
and -- with a terrible shriek -- TOPPLES OVER THE RAILING.

The hook in his jacket jerks him up short... leaving him
to DANGLE thirty feet above the factory floor!

ANGLE ON COMMISSIONER GORDON

His gaze whips upward from the dangling hood to the
figure on the catwalk.  As he's just realized... there
is a bat.

		GORDON
	Oh my God!!

INT. CHEMICAL SUPPLY ROOM - THAT MOMENT

Jack looking for an exit.  Behind him, a STEEL DOOR
begins to rise -- more COPS.  He picks up the axe and
runs to bottom of iron stairs to huge steel containers
with DANGER!  HIGHLY TOXIC written on them under SKULL
AND CROSSBONES.  He swings the axe releasing a river of
wild-colored poisons.

ANGLE ON COPS

At the bottom of the stairs, they RETREAT hastily, bump-
ing into each other, as POISONS FLOOD toward them.  Jack
on other side of the chemical moat, throws away the axe
and climbs the stairs.

INT. FACTORY FLOOR - A MOMENT LATER

A RIVER OF CHEMICALS courses out into the main refinery.
COPS SLIP AND SLIDE on the wet surface of the factory
floor GASPING on ACID FUMES.

METAL STAIRS LEADING TO CATWALK

Jack climbs metal stairs.  Above him, vats of CHURNING
CHEMICAL SLUDGE -- and SLUICE GATES opening on the East
River.  It's the waste dump.

UP ON THE CATWALK, Batman slips into the shadows and
watches Jack approach.

Jack reaches the catwalk.  Located above the center of
it is a glass paneled WINDOW, propped open by a support-
ing rod.  Beyond this is a forty foot drop to the swirl-
ing black currents of the East River... and freedom.  To
reach the window, Jack will be exposed to police bullets.
He makes a dash for it, and has begun to climb up to it
on the catwalk railings, when BATMAN HURTLES IN and puts
him in a wrestling hold.  Jack struggles for a moment,
then registers what's hit him and freaks out.

		JACK
	Jesus!

But just then...

		VOICE
	HOLD IT!

ANGLE ON FACTORY FLOOR - THAT MOMENT

Bob's got a gun pointed AT COMMISSIONER GORDON'S HEAD.

		BOB
	Let him go or I'll do Gordon.

A tense moment passes.

Eckhardt appears on floor.  Looks up at Jack.

CATWALK - A MOMENT LATER

Batman releases Jack and stands clear.  Jack straightens
his clothes and fixes his hair.

		JACK
		(smirking at Batman)
	Nice outfit.

		GOON
	Jack, let's get out of here.

Jack spies .38 AUTOMATIC abandoned an the catwalk.

ANGLE ON FACTORY FLOOR

Eckhardt uses this moment to sneak away.  A voice breaks
the tension:

		JACK
	Eckhardt!!  Think about the
	future!

ALL EYES TURN to Jack standing poised with the .38 in his
fist.  He FIRES.  Eckhardt FALLS DEAD.  Jack turns gun
to Gordon.

Batman moves.  Jack spins on Batman.

Their eyes meet for a second.

TIGHT ON BATMAN

-- a questioning look on his face.  A spark.

TIGHT ON JACK

-- a small smile plays on his lips.

ON TRIGGER

-- He FIRES POINT BLANK at Batman.

ON BATMAN

--  he swings his heavy cape.  The BULLET RICOCHETS
DIRECTLY BACK AT JACK.

AN UNGODLY HOWL OF PAIN echoes out from the catwalk
above.  Jack reels and staggers, CLUTCHING AT HIS CHEEKS.
BLOOD GUSHES from between his fingers.

JACK NAPIER HAS BEEN SHOT THROUGH THE FACE.

He staggers into the catwalk railing and topples over,
just managing to grab hold of the lowest rung.  Directly
beneath him is a catch basin full of BUBBLING TOXIC WASTE.

ON CATWALK - THAT MOMENT

Batman leaps and tries to grab Jack's hand.

Jack drops but catches himself on a pipe.  He's slipping.

Batman reaches, gets a poor grip.  He stares, perplexed.
at the stricken expression in Jack's eyes.

						CUT TO:

ON CATWALK - SAME MOMENT

Jack is sliding out of Batman's grasp.  A long BEAT --
Jack looks up at him in terror and SLIPS AWAY to plunge
the TWO STORIES DOWN into the CATCH BASIN of BUBBLING,
TOXIC WASTE, SCREAMING ALL THE WAY.

ANGLE ON FACTORY FLOOR - MOMENT LATER

		GORDON
	Goddammit, we had him!

COPS level their guns on Batman.  A couple of them appear
at either end of the catwalk, effectively blocking his
escape.  He takes in the situation, HANDS ON HIS BELT.

		GORDON
	Hold it right there..

Batman raises his hands in a gesture of surrender.  As
the COPS advance from both ends of the catwalk -- he
flicks two tiny capsules at the nearby wall.

A BLINDING FLASH OF LIGHT.  Colors burst in a wild pyro-
technic display.  COPS stumble backwards, momentarily
dazzled, as a THICK WALL OF BLACK SMOKE conceals Batman
from view.

A tiny grappling hook rockets out of the dense curling
cloud and catches on the edge of a window in the roof.

		COP
	Look!

The COPS are FIRING WILDLY into the smoke.  But the BLACK
MAJESTIC FIGURE OF THE Batman whips upward, DISAPPEARING
into the shadowy heights, safely out of range.

		COP
	... Who is this guy?

		GORDON
		(to Cop)
	I don't know and until we find
	out, keep a lid on it.

						CUT TO:

EXT. AXIS CHEMICAL COMPANY - NIGHT (THAT MOMENT)

A BLACK SHADOW scurries across the roof.  From the il-
luminated sign with its neon ace, WE PAN DOWN PAST the
chemical sluice TO a SECOND ACE... a card from Jack's
lucky deck, pierced by a neat, round bullet hole, bobbing
on the oily surface of the foul, polluted river.

Gradually, OTHER CARDS from the deck swirl past:  a nine.
A deuce.  A queen.  And finally, a Joker -- SHOT CLEANLY
THROUGH THE FACE.

A BONE-WHITE HAND BREAKS THE SURFACE as we --

						SHOCK CUT TO:

INT. GOTHAM GLOBE - CITY ROOM - DAY

A BANNER HEADLINE on the late edition of the Globe:
""BATMAN FOILS ROBBERY. JACK NAPIER DEAD.  WHO IS MASKED
VIGILANTE?""

Behind the newspaper, feet propped up on his desk, is a
jubilant Knox.  He's on the horn to Gordon.

		KNOX
	Yes, Commissioner.  If there's no
	Bat, then who dropped this guy
	Napier into the acid?  Wait a
	minute, I want to get this on
	tape.

He holds a tape recorder up to phone.  Listens.  A LOUD
CLICK as Gordon hangs up on him.

Vicki BUSTLES IN with sheaf of photographs.  Starts to
hang them on wail.  Making a photomontage of the city.
Cartoonist sticks head in door, tapes drawing of Batman
with arm on Knox's shoulder.  GUY EXITS.  Knox hangs up.

		KNOX
	Vicki Vale!  (I'm) Nostradamus!

		VICKI
	Look at this, Allie.

Knox comes around.  She points to her montage map.

		VICKI
	Here's the inner city, and here's
	Axis Chemicals.  Here are the
	sightings so far.

		KNOX
	Did you do this?  This is great.

		VICKI
	Maybe the Batman's got some sort
	of flight pattern or something.

		KNOX
	Yeah, tonight we'll walk the
	trail.

		VICKI
	Tomorrow maybe.  I've got a date
	with Bruce Wayne.  Sorry.

		KNOX
		(shouting)
	Bruce Wayne?  No, A DATE is when
	two normal people go out to enjoy
	each other.  A date for Bruce
	WAYNE is when he goes out to a
	restaurant with mirrors, by
	HIMSELF!

She plants a kiss on his forehead.

		VICKI
	You're awfully sweet to be so
	concerned but thanks anyway.

Vicki smiles and EXITS.  Knox looks pole-axed.

		KNOX
		(irritated, picking
		 up phone)
	Copy, get me the morgue.
		(BEAT)
	Morgue... give me all you got on
	Bruce Wayne.

						CUT TO:

EXT. BRUCE'S ESTATE - RIDING STABLES - SUNDOWN

Bruce and Vicki GALLOP UP on horseback.  They dismount;
Bruce grooms his horse.  Vicki watches.

		VICKI
	You're not bad on a horse.

		BRUCE
	Horses love me.  I keep falling
	OFF.  Maybe that's why they love
	me.  You should see me, I'm one
	big mass of bruises.

		VICKI
		(laughing)
	Maybe we can arrange a little
	examination?

Bruce, without missing a beat, puts the curry comb up on
a rail and turns to her.

		BRUCE
	Yeah, how about right now?

Vicki is caught in her own sexual trap.

		VICKI
	Just kidding.

		BRUCE
	You thought you had me, didn't
	you?

Bruce smiles and walks past her up to the main house.
Vicki smiles.

EXT. WAYNE MANOR - PATIO - SUNDOWN

A broad patio behind the manor, looking out on the es-
tate.  Bruce and Vicki ARRIVE from the stables.  Alfred
APPEARS with a bottle of champagne, smiles discreetly at
Vicki, then DISAPPEARS.  Bruce POPS the cork unhandily.

		ALFRED
	The historical Society called to
	remind you of the banquet.  Should
	I say you'll be there?

		BRUCE
	Yes, absolutely... I'll be there.

Alfred starts to walk away.  Bruce thinks.

		BRUCE
	Alfred... Which Society?

		ALFRED
	Historical.

		BRUCE
	Oh, yeah, right.  Yes.

Alfred EXITS.

		VICKI
	That Alfred's great.

		BRUCE
	I can't find my socks without
	him.  Been with the family since
	I was born.

Pouring, he tries, unsuccessfully to stifle a yawn.

		VICKI
		 (amused, teasing him)
	Am I keeping you up?

		BRUCE
		(slightly embarrassed)
	I'm sorry.  I've got a lot going
	on at the moment.

		VICKI
	Like who?

		BRUCE
		(flustered)
	No... Just business... I'll be
	honest with you, I bore myself
	silly, tell me about you.

		VICKI
	I take pictures.  And I love doing
	it.   I feel naked without a camera.

		BRUCE
		(little smile)
	Well we better get you one.
		(as she smiles)
	Go on.

		VICKI
	I'd been floating around for a
	while, doing fashion.  It was
	alright... I don't know.  Things
	change.
		(searching for an
		 explanation)
	How old are you?

		BRUCE
	Just turned 35.

		VICKI
	You've probably had it happen too.
	You know... you wake up one
	morning and say, hey this is who
	I am.  I see things through
	cameras.  All kinds of things.
	Not just long legs and great
	skirts, but... things... You know?

		BRUCE
	I'm not sure.

		VICKI
	Well... I just picked up and left.

		BRUCE
	What did you see?

		VICKI
		(sigh, BEAT)
	A lot'a hotels.  A little terror.  A
	little love once in a blue moon.

		BRUCE
		(pandering it)
	A little terror.  A little love.

		VICKI
		(softly)
	It's out there.  I was never in
	the right place I guess.

Bruce looks around at his opulent estate, falls SILENT.

		VICKI
	You're a little elusive, Mr.
	Wayne.  I feel like there's a lot
	going on in there.

		BRUCE
	Oh... not really.

		VICKI
	Come on, say what you're thinking.

		BRUCE
	I was just thinking how beautiful
	you looked on that horse... and
	that... it's kinda nice to have
	someone here who notices things.

She finds herself irrevocably drawn in.

		VICKI
		(mischievous; offer-
		 ing her hand)
	See... I do have an extraordinary
	eye.

		BRUCE
		(taking her hand)
	Two.

INT. WAYNE MANOR - NIGHT

A vast, darkened entry hall, framed by long semicircular
stairways on either side.  Bruce and Vicki enter; she's
giddy.

		VICKI
	I feel like I'm in Paris in the
	'30s.  Is this fair?  I'm half
	drunk and you're not even --

		BRUCE
	Two drinks and I'm flying.

Vicky smiles.  They stare into each other's eyes for a
moment, on the verge of kissing.

He's struggling with something.  She touches him.

		VICKY
	Why are you afraid of flying?

He steps towards her and they begin a kiss which turns
into a passionate embrace.  A FLASH OF LIGHTNING trans-
ports us to:

EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT

Broken windows, graffiti on the walls:  a waterfront
rathole.

INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - NIGHT

TIGHT ON a face swathed in bandages.  The patient sits
erect in a wooden chair, surrounded by the grimy para-
phernalia of an unlicensed gangland doctor.

The DOCTOR, a nervous little ferret, steps up with a
pair of scissors.

		DOCTOR
	Well, let's see how we did.

He begins to snip away.  As the bandages come off, we
get:

JACK NAPIER'S POV

The last strands of gauze peel back.  The DOCTOR stands
there, looking at his handiwork.  His mouth falls open.
His eyes bug out.  He GASPS.

		JACK (O.S.)
	Mirror.

The DOCTOR just stands there staring AT CAMERA, stock-
still, apparently transfixed by the sight of Jack's face.

		JACK (O.S.)
	Mirror.

ANGLE ON DOCTOR

He clears his throat, reaches apprehensively for a hand
mirror, and passes it OUT OF FRAME to Jack.

We hear a GASP and SOB.  Two beats.  Then, the sound of
GLASS SHATTERING as the mirror drops to the floor.  The
DOCTOR gulps hard.

		DOCTOR
	You understand that the nerves
	were completely severed -- Mr.
	Napier --

Jack begins to LAUGH. The DOCTOR turns uneasily away,
gestures apologetically at his seedy equipment.

		DOCTOR
	-- You see what I had to work
	with here --

More laughter.  The trembling DOCTOR covers his face with
one hand, whining now, not daring to look at Jack.

		DOCTOR
	-- I'm sure that with proper recon
	-- recon -- reconstructive
	surgery --

A DOOR SLAMS.  Jack is gone.  The grateful DOCTOR breathes
a sigh of relief and steadies himself on an operating
table as Jack's AWFUL LAUGH ECHOES in the hall outside.

		DOCTOR
		(puzzled)
	What's so funny?

INT. BRUCE WAYNE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Vicki is asleep.  CAMERA PANS TO Bruce lying next to her.
He's silently looking at the cascade of her hair on the
pillow.  He watches her face, perplexed.  Grandfather
CLOCK CLANGS.  He checks his watch, stands up and looks
out window.  He's constrained.  He stretches impatiently.

ON CLOCK FACE

TIME HAS PASSED.  PAN TO VICKI -- sleeping.  A RHYTHMIC
SOUND.  She stirs, half-wakes.  CAMERA PANS to see Bruce,
upside-down, SLIGHTLY SWAYING in inversion boots.

INT. GRISSOM'S PENTHOUSE - NIGHT

The private elevator HISSES open.  JACK steps out,
bundled up in a trenchcoat, muffler, and slouch hat --
his face concealed from view.  He plops in the big plush
swivel chair behind Grissom's desk.

		GRISSOM (O.S.)
	That you, sugar bumps?

Grissom WADDLES IN fresh out of the shower, a towel
wrapped around him.  Using a smaller towel to dry his
hair, it's a moment before he sees the bundled-up figure
at his desk.

		GRISSOM
	Who the hell are you?

		JACK
	It's me.  ""Sugar Bumps.""

		GRISSOM
	Jack?
		(advancing
		 cautiously)
	Thank God you're alive.  I heard
	you'd been...

		JACK
	Fried.  Is that what you heard?

Jack stands and gestures him over to the empty chair.
Grissom moves when he sees the gun pointing at his belly.

		JACK
	YOU SET ME UP!
		(beat)
	Over a girl.  You must be insane!

Grissom surreptitiously reaches for a desk drawer.

		JACK
	Don't bother.

		GRISSOM
	Your life won't be worth spit.

		JACK
	I been dead once already.  It's
	very liberating -- You have to
	think of it as therapy.

		GRISSOM
		(beginning to panic)
	Jack, listen -- we'll cut a deal --

		JACK
	Jack?  Jack's dead, my friend.
	You can call me Joker.

He flings away the hat.  RIPS THE MUFFLER from his face.
And -- as Grissom gasps in shock -- stands revealed in
his full horrendous glory.

His flesh is bleached bone-white.  His hair is a luminous
seaweed-green.  And his cheeks are torn and puckered from
the bullet wound, TWISTING HIS MOUTH INTO A HIDEOUS,
PERPETUAL HARLEQUIN'S GRIN.

		JACK
	And as you can see, I'm much
	happier.

Jack begins to GIGGLE, building to hysterical LAUGHTER.
Grissom makes a lunge towards his desk drawer.  Jack
FIRES.  AND FIRES AGAIN UNTIL THE CLIP IS EMPTY.

EXT. GRISSOM'S BUILDING - NIGHT

We TILT UP the facade of the skyscraper, arriving finally
at the TOP FLOOR:  a PLATE GLASS WINDOW spiderwebbed with
cracks where Jack's bullets hit.

INT. GRISSOM'S PENTHOUSE - NIGHT (THAT MOMENT)

Darkness.  JACK -- or, as we'll know him from this moment
on, The JOKER -- sits in Grissom's swivel chair and
surveys the moon-drenched city.

		JOKER
		(nostalgically)
	Gotham City.  It always brings
	a smile to my face.

As he swivels in the chair he notices a copy of the Globe
(now blood-splattered) lying on Grissom's desk.  The head-
line catches his eye.  WINGED FREAK TERRORIZES GOTHAM'S
GANGLAND.  He picks up the paper and starts HUMMING.

		JOKER
	Watch it, Batman.  Wait'll they
	get a load of me.

						DISSOLVE TO:

INT. BRUCE WAYNE'S BEDROOM - DAY

Bruce is asleep, his legs over the back of a chaise
lounge.  Vicki is dressing.  Alert.

		VICKI
	Bruce.  I'm late, but I've a
	proposition.

Bruce sits up wearily.

		VICKI
	I'll make us lunch tomorrow.
	At my apartment.  I'll show you
	same of my photos.  Will you come?

He's stretching.  A hesitation flashes in his eyes.

		BRUCE
	Sure. Oh no... I -- I can't make
	it.

Vicki stops brushing her hair.  Checks out his vibes.

		VICKI
	Oh.  Is anything wrong?

		BRUCE
	No -- I -- I've got a real
	important meeting.

		VICKI
	Well... later in the day?

		BRUCE
	No... I... I've got to leave town
	for a few days.

Vicki wonders, but continues.

		VICKI
	Well... when you get back.

Bruce thinks.  No answer.  Not wanting too much vulner-
ability herself, she lightens it up.

		VICKI
	Hey, I've got to get moving.  See
	you.

She pecks him on the cheek and breezes by him.

		BRUCE
	Yeah.  I'll see you.

DOOR SHUTS.  Bruce thinks.

IN HALLWAY - ON ALFRED

Alfred shows her out the door.

		ALFRED
	So nice to see you again, Miss
	Vale.

		VICKI
	Yeah.  I guess I'll see you when
	you guys get back.

		ALFRED
	Back, ma'am?  We're here for quite
	a while I believe.

		VICKI
	Oh... never mind.  See you.

But she noticed.  And it hurt a little.  Bruce was lying.

INT. ALICIA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Alicia, with an armload of dress bags, ENTERS -- and is
startled by a VOICE FROM BEHIND.

		JOKER (O.S.)
	Honey!

She pivots.  Her eyes widen.  She SHRIEKS.

Sitting cross-legged in an easy chair is The Joker.  He's
in a smoking jacket and slippers, reading the paper, a
dry martini at his side.

		JOKER
	You wouldn't believe what happened
	to me today.

Alicia faints.

INT. PENTHOUSE SUITE - NIGHT

GANGLORDS stare at Joker at the head of the table.

		JOKER (O.S.)
	So that's how it is, gentlemen.
	Until Grissom resurfaces... I'm
	the acting President.  And I say
	we start with this Anniversary
	festival and run this city into
	the ground.

Joker's dressed in a big slouch hat.  His FACE is layered
with flesh-toned makeup, and his HAIR's been rinsed black.
But he can't conceal his ghoulish SMILE.  VINNIE RICORSO
is the smartest of the bunch.  He doesn't believe Joker
for a minute.

		RICORSO
	Why don't we hear this from
	Grissom?


		ROTELLI
	How come you re wearing that stupid
	smirk?

		JOKER
	Because life's been good to me.

CARMINE ROTELLI, an exceptionally oily mobster, speaks up:

		ROTELLI
	What if we say no?

		JOKER
	Nobody wants a war, Carmine.  If
	we can't do business, we shake
	hands... and that's it.

		ROTELLI
	Yeah?

		JOKER
	Yeah.

ROTELLI stands up and extends a hand.  Joker shakes.
A JOY BUZZER's concealed in Joker's palm.

40,000 VOLTS course through ROTELLI's body.  He drops
back into his seat a blackened husk, SMOKE pouring out
from his sleeves and shirt collar.

A SQUAD OF ARMED THUGS BURSTS INTO THE ROOM.  These THUGS
have all been specially selected and distinctively STYLED
by the JOKER.  (NOTE:  these are the first of Joker's
creations   We now begin to see Joker restyling every-
thing in his world.)

BOB's now Joker's number two man, staying close to him.

		JOKER
	Carmine got a little hot under the
	collar.

The Joker begins to LAUGH at his own joke.

		RICORSO
		(getting up to leave)
	... You're insane!

		JOKER
		(affronted innocence)
	Haven't you heard of the healing
	power of laughter?

He begins to LAUGH again, removes his hat and mops sweat
from his brow, exposing a patch of CHALK-WHITE FLESH --
to the bewilderment of the ONLOOKERS.

		JOKER
	Now GET OUT OF HERE -- And give it
	some thought.

Gangsters are ESCORTED OUT by the Joker's thugs.  Joker
grabs a copy of the Globe.

		JOKER
	Bob, I want you to take a camera
	and follow this reporter Knox.
	Find out what he knows about
	Batman.  You got to learn to USE
	people, Bob.

		BOB
	Yes sir.

BOB EXITS, leaving the JOKER alone with the charred
corpse of ROTELLI.  The Joker ADDRESSES THE BODY.

		JOKER
	Your pals, they're not such bad
	guys.  What d'you say we give 'em
	a couple of days to come round?
		(pause; apparently
		 listening to the
		 corpse)
	No?
		(listens again)
	Grease 'em now?
		(seems shocked)
	Okay.
		(shakes his head mock
		 sorrowfully)
	You're a vicious bastard, Rotelli.
	I'm glad you're dead.

INT. NEWSPAPER MORGUE - DAY

Vicki looks through filing cabinets.  She's intense.
Over her shoulder a FILE APPEARS with BRUCE WAYNE on it.
Knox has it.

		VICKI
	I'm looking for that.

She grabs it and looks through the very thin file.

		KNOX
	I thought we were a team here.
	I'm losing confidence in you --
	going out with this weirdo.

		VICKY
	Speaking strictly professionally
	right?  This wouldn't be personal
	issue for you would it?

		KNOX
	I just want you to do your job.

		VICKI
	I AM doing my job.

		KNOX
	Me too.  I'm protecting my partner.
	The guy collects weird weapons in
	Japan, probably roller skates
	through the female population like
	a bulldozer.

		VICKI
	Where does it say that, Knox?
	There's nothing in this file but
	social puffery.  No photos, no
	history.  Nothing.  That's strange.
	Where's he get his money?  What's
	he do all day?  Who is he?

She tosses the file on the floor angrily.  EXITS.

		KNOX
	Who cares?

						DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. WAYNE MANOR - NEXT MORNING

Vicki in car a block from the Manor.  She looks through
her telephoto lens.  After a few BEATS -- Bruce Wayne
emerges from the gates, walking.  He's dressed incognito.
He carries a package.

Vicki FOLLOWS him.

CAMERA FOLLOWS ACTION THROUGH:

EXT. GOTHAM STREETS - DAY

As Bruce walks through the city.  He puts on sunglasses
and seems interested in not being seen.

Vicki follows along, at a distance.

EXT. BAD STREET - DAY

The neighborhood is now bad.  Few people are around.
Bruce ENTERS a blind alley.

Vicki steals up to corner to see what he's doing.

EXT. BLIND ALLEY - DAY

Bruce looks at the trash-scattered alley.  He looks up
at the sky, then down at a corner.  He kicks away a Coke
can, cleans off a spat.

ON VICKI

puzzled she raises her camera.

ON BRUCE

He unwraps the package.

Vicki strains to see what he's holding.

Bruce moves a bit and reveals TWO LONG-STEMMED ROSES.

Vicki raises camera and SOFTLY CLICKS THE SHUTTER.

ON BRUCE

He kneels and places the roses as if at a shrine.  He
holds his hand on his eyes for a BEAT.

Vicki looks and CLICKS again.  What is he doing?

ON BRUCE

He stands and kicks the can back out toward the street.
He heads out the alley.  Where's Vicki?  When he passes
by where she was.  She's gone.

EXT. ANOTHER STREET - DAY

Bruce walks down Broad Street which leads into the City
Square.

CAMERA LINGERS -- Vicki follows at a distance.

ON BRUCE

As he enters the City Square.

A PAINTED STREET MIME walks alongside him, feeling his
way along an imaginary wall.  He is not very good at it,
and in spite of his heavy makeup you can tell that he's
rather ugly.

A COMMOTION catches Bruce's eye.  He steps back to the
edge of the gathered crowd.

EXT. CITY HALL - THAT MOMENT

RICORSO -- the CRIMELORD from the boardroom -- emerges
flanked by a LAWYER and a pair of BODYGUARDS.  They're
met by a group of REPORTERS.  Including Knox.

ON VICKI

She peers around.  Looking for Bruce.  Can't see him.

		REPORTER
	So what is this affidavit you've
	filed?  Grissom gave you all of
	his businesses?

		RICORSO
	Mr. Grissom asked me, as a personal
	favor, to take over the operation
	of his businesses until he returned.

		KNOX
	Jeezez, that's a pretty big gift.
	You must have been VERY close.
	Did you do a little time together
	as children?

Ricorso sneers.  OTHERS LAUGH.

		KNOX
	I smell fresh ink, guys.  I'm sure
	you can prove all this?  Why am I
	asking?  Of course you can.

ANGLE ON VICKI

Getting closer.

ANGLE ON BRUCE

Something catches his eye.

HIS POV - A HALF A DOZEN STREET MIMES

converging on the scene.  Something's very wrong.  (These
are Joker's men.)

Vicki ARRIVES next to Knox.

ANGLE ON BOB

taking photos of Knox and Vicki from edge of the crowd.

ON LAWYER - TIGHT

		LAWYER
	We have witnesses.
	Grissom's signature is perfectly
	legitimate.

		VOICE (O.S.)
	It's legitimate!  I saw him.  I
	was THERE!

Crowd parts as a LARGE MIME steps up to Ricorso.  Ricorso
frowns.

		NEW GUY
	I saw it all, he raised his dead
	hand and signed the paper in his
	own blood.  And he did it with
	this pen!

Mime pulls out a ridiculously long quill pen.  Ricorso
gapes in puzzlement at him.

TIGHT ON NEW GUY

Underneath the white skull cap -- it's the Joker.

		JOKER
		(lifting his wig)
	Hello, Vinnie -- it's me, your
	uncle Bingo, time to pay the
	check!

Joker HURLS the sharp-tipped pen right into Ricorso's
throat.  Ricorso falls, clutching his throat.

Someone SCREAMS, reporters SCATTER as MIMES FIRE MACHINE
GUNS IN THE AIR.

Vicki dives behind a parked car.  She looks back to see
Bruce, standing frozen, rooted to the ground.  He's
watching, transfixed.

Mayhem prevails.

ANGLE ON BRUCE

BRUCE is still frozen to the spot and exposed to the
""mimes.""

A FEW FEET AWAY

Vicki crouches behind the car and beckons to him.

		VICKI
	Bruce!  Get DOWN!

He totally ignores her and BEGINS TO WALK.  At first
slowly, then faster, right toward the Joker.

ANGLE ON BODYGUARDS

ON JOKER

He LAUGHS at the DIN and walks as if immortal through the
mayhem.  (He never sees Bruce.)

ON BRUCE

He's walking the same way, still at a distance from
Joker.  But his recognition of him is growing.

ON JOKER

He reaches his car.  DRIVER rushes to get him out of
there.

Bruce now gets close enough to see Joker's face through
the window.  Joker's car SPEEDS AWAY past him.

Other cars containing other mimes SPEED AWAY, too.  A
SILENCE DESCENDS.  Only the SOUNDS OF CRYING and ebbing
fear.

Bruce stands looking after Joker.
Suddenly Vicki is there.

		VICKI
	Bruce...?

No answer.  He hardly seems to notice she is there.

Bruce turns to her.  Sweat pouring down his face.  Looks
right into her eyes.  She looks at him and sees the signs
of deep trauma in his eyes.

		BRUCE
	I'm sorry, Vicki...

He turns and DISAPPEARS into the crowd.

		VICKI
	Bruce!

						CUT TO:

INSERT - TELEVISION SCREEN

A TV CREW broadcasting live from the massacre site.

The minicam angle WIDENS to include HARVEY DENT and the
Mayor.  The ANCHORWOMAN thrusts a mike in Mayor's face:

		ANCHORWOMAN
	Does this gang war dampen the
	city's plans for the 200th
	anniversary festival?

		MAYOR
	The festival opens. The police
	are going to stop these gangsters.

		ANCHORWOMAN
	Mr. Dent, what do you think of
	the theory that the mysterious
	'Batman' is a mob enforcer killing
	these men?

Suddenly there is a terrific SCREAM OF RAGE from O.S.
and the TV SCREEN SHATTERS.

JOKER'S BOARD ROOM

The CAMERA PULLS BACK from the smashed and smoking TV,
placing us in the JOKER's BOARD ROOM.

JOKER's in his swivel chair holding an extendible/re-
tractable pincer on the end of which is a boxing glove
making a fist.  By squeezing the handle of this he has
punched the ""fist"" through the TV screen.  BOB ENTERS.

		JOKER
		(furious)
	Batman!  BATMAN!  Can somebody
	please tell me what kind of a
	world we live in where a man
	dressed as a bat gets my airtime!?
	This city needs an enema!

He STORMS OUT of the office into:

INT. AXIS CHEMICAL COMPANY - DAY

LOW ANGLE ON the JOKER.  He rushes along a catwalk high
above the refinery floor.  He passes a COUPLE OF UGLY,
CRIMINALLY-MINDED SCIENTISTS in white coats, holding
sheets of calculations.

		JOKER
		(SHOUTING over the
		 noise)
	Have we shipped a million of these
	things?

		SCIENTIST
	Yes SIR!

		JOKER
	Ship it all.  Untangle the knots,
	roll the wheels, I've got my blood
	up!

The Scientists look at each other and RUSH into action.

Joker BANGS OPEN THE DOOR TO:

INT. JOKER'S LAIR - DAY

A dank, windowless room in the bowels of Axis Chemical.
Joker is HUMMING, insanely.

THE CAMERA TRAVELS PAST collages of photographs; each
photograph cut from scenes of war.

The CAMERA CONTINUES DOWN a stack of folders.  On one
document are the initials C.I.A.  On the front of the
folder can be read ""DDID NERVE GAS -- RESULTS OF
PRELIMINARY EXPERIMENTATION"" and stamped across it,
""DISCONTINUED 1977.""  Finally, we see the photos of dead
soldiers, lips drawn back in chemical-induced grimaces.

		JOKER
	Losing is a bad habit, Bob.  So
	much to do and so little time.

BOB STEALS IN and offers some photographs.

		BOB
	Here's the photos.

Joker looks them over.

TIGHT ON PHOTOS

Joker shuffles through.  Stops on Knox.

		JOKER
	Who's this dud?

		BOB
	That's Knox.

		JOKER
	Bad tie.  No style.

ON A PHOTO OF VICKI WITH KNOX

		JOKER
	Stop the press!!  Who is that?

		BOB
	That's Vicki Vale, she's the
	photographer working with Knox.

TIGHT ON JOKER

He's licking his lips.  Looking Vicki up and down.

		JOKER
	THAT WOMAN has style!!  Jeezus
	Marimba!  A lovely beast like
	that could get a man up and
	running.

The JOKER, excitedly HUMMING AWAY begins to cut Vicki's
picture out of the others.  Leaving a border around her.
He then fills in border with crayons.

		BOB
	She's been dating some guy named
	Wayne.

		JOKER
	She's gonna trade up!  Damn!  It's
	hard to stay inside the lines!

Joker pastes Vicki's picture onto a board.

		JOKER
	I'm gonna get me a NEW girl,
	Bobbie.

THE CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal that the JOKER is sur-
rounded, wall to wall, by a collage of pictures of war
and destruction.  The huge collage forms a birds-eye-
view map of Gotham.

		JOKER
	I've got a mind to make some
	mayhem.  Phone book!

INT. WAYNE MANOR - BRUCE'S STUDY - DAY

Alfred uses a feather duster.  BRUCE ENTERS, obviously
distraught and exhausted.  Very concerned, Alfred takes
his coat and hands Bruce a hot towel.  Bruce wipes his
hands.

		ALFRED
	Miss Vale called.  She was rather
	concerned.
		(matchmaking a bit)
	I've noticed that there is a
	certain weight that lifts when
	she's here.

		BRUCE
	Why don't you marry her, Alfred?

		ALFRED
	That's not exactly what I had in
	mind, sir.

		BRUCE
	I can't go on with that, Alfred.
		(as Alfred nods)
	Napier's alive.  He's running
	Grissom's men.  I gotta find out
	everything the police have on him.

		ALFRED
	Yes, sir.

		BRUCE
	She's good isn't she?

Bruce smiles.  Alfred smiles sadly, too.

INT. VICKI' S APARTMENT - DAY (THAT MOMENT)

Puzzled, Vicki looks through her photos of Bruce and
his flowers.

ON SEVERAL PHOTOS

of Bruce along his puzzling route.

TILT UP:  Vicki dials Knox.

		VICKI
	Allie.  I want you to check
	something for me.  Okay?  Find out
	what's so special about the alley
	at Pearl and Phillips Streets.
	'Bye.

She hangs up.  Looks at photos.

		VICKI
	What's up with you, Mr. Wayne?

PHONE RINGS.  SHE PICKS IT UP.

		TONY (V.O.)
	Vicki, this is Tony.  We have a
	session scheduled and the client
	INSISTS that you shoot it.

		VICKI
	Me?  Tony, I'm kind of busy.

		TONY (V.O.)
	The client says he has information
	about Batman.

Vicki puzzles.  Chews her lip.

		VICKI
	Batman?  When's the session?

		TONY (V.O.)
	This afternoon at 3:00.

		VICKI
	Alright, I'll be there.

She hangs up and thinks.

INT. PHOTOGRAPHER'S STUDIO - DAY

ROWS OF MAKEUP in startling profusion:  mascara, blusher,
eyeliner, lipstick.  BEAUTIFUL MODELS giggle into their
makeup mirrors as VICKI wanders past.

In a corner of the studio, TONY, a gaunt, tubercular
British art director, is dressing a swimsuit layout with
two SUPERMODEL5.  They all AD LIB GREETINGS to VICKI.

		TONY
	Come on, girls, magic Vicki is
	here.  Shine it.  Think of the
	money.  That's it.

Vicki gets out her camera.

		VICKI
	Tony.  Who's this client that
	knows about Batman?

		TONY
	Never met him.  All I know is
	he pays cash.

		VICKI
	What's his name?

		TONY
	Mr. Kerr.

		VICKI
	Mr. Kerr?  What's his first name?

		TONY
	Joseph, Joe Kerr.

A look of fear comes over Vicki's face.

As Vicki looks on, the SUPERMODELS freeze in place
simultaneously, a strange, STRICKEN LOOK on their faces.

		TONY
	Jesus!  Hurry up!  Vicki's
	expensive.  Show her some bones.

Suddenly the girls are LAUGHING -- but the laughter is
unnatural, involuntary.  Vicki, sensing that something is
terribly wrong, lays a hand on Tony's arm.

The MODELS, now wearing HUGE SMILES, go into VIOLENT
SPASMS.

		TONY
	Is this some sort of joke? -- OH
	MY GOD!

The SUPERMODELS PITCH TO THE FLOOR, shuddering convul-
sively, their LIPS drawn back in FRIGHTFUL, FROZEN,
CHEMICAL-WARFARE-TYPE GRINS.  Vicki GASPS.

						CUT TO:

INT. TELEVISION STUDIO - EVENING

The ""ACTION NEWS"" set, with anchors BECKY NARITA and
PETER McELROY.

		BECKY
	The fashion world was stunned
	today by the sudden deaths of
	models Candy Walker and Amanda
	Keeler.  Cause of death has been
	attributed to a violent allergic
	reaction, although authorities
	have not ruled out the possibility
	of drug use.  Peter?

		PETER
	... and plans continue for the
	city's 200th birthday as Mayor
	Borg announced the unveiling of a
	statue of John T. Gotham, Gotham's
	founder --

A TECHNICIAN'S HAND passes a slip of paper INTO FRAME.

		PETER
	This just in.  Three mysterious
	deaths at a beauty parlor in --

Off to the left, BECKY begins to LAUGH.  PETER FROWNS.

		PETER
	Becky!  This is hardly the --
		(his eyes widen)
	BECKY!!

An O.S. CRASH.  PETER jumps out of his seat, mouth agape
in horror.

BECKY HAS GONE INTO CONVULSIONS.  CAMERA WHIPS RIGHT AND
LEFT as she jerks out of her seat and TOTTERS UNCONTROL-
LABLY across the set, LAUGHING INSANELY.

TECHNICIANS rush the sound stage in a frenzy.  BECKY
spins like a dervish and LURCHES BACKWARD over the news
desk in a death spasm, giving us a quick look at the
grisly Joker's grin etched on her now-lifeless face.

		PETER
	KILL THE CAMERA!!  KILL THE --

Suddenly, CRACKLING VIDEO STATIC wipes out the screen.  A
moment later, we're looking at:

SPLITSCREEN CLOSEUP - THE SUPERMODELS

Their gorgeous faces sprout BIG, ANIMATED-CARTOON GRINS
as a BOUNCY TUNE -- ""Put on a Happy Face"" -- comes up
underneath.

		MODELS
		(cartoon voice)
	... Love that Joker!

INT. SUPERMARKET - DAY

MUSIC CONTINUES as a deranged pitchman -- The Joker --
pushes his shopping cart down the aisle.  He waves
merrily in time to the music.

INT. STUDIO - VIDEO CONTROL BOOTH - THAT MOMENT

TECHNICIANS swarm the booth.  The studio feed has been
JAMMED.  Every monitor shows the Joker's PROMO.

		DIRECTOR
	WHERE'S IT COMING FROM??

		TECHNICIAN
	I DON'T KNOW!

CLOSEUP - THE JOKER

He thrusts a brightly-colored package AT the CAMERA.

		JOKER
	... new improved Joker brand.
	With my secret sauce... SMYLEX!
		(a sweep of the hand)
	Let's go to our blind taste test.

TIGHT ON ANONYMOUS MAN

GAGGED AND BLINDFOLDED, tied to his chair, squirming,
struggling.  On the table before him is a package label-
led ""BRAND X.""  A SUPERIMPOSED TITLE reads:  ""NOT AN
ACTOR.""

		JOKER
	Ooh.  He's not happy!  He's been
	using Brand X!  But with new
	improved Joker brand...

ANGLE WIDENS to include a BLINDFOLDED CORPSE, limp in his
chair, GRINNING HORRIFICALLY.

		JOKER
	... I get a GRIN -- AGAIN AND
	AGAIN!!

INT. GOTHAM BEDROOM - THAT MOMENT

A YOUNG MAN watching TV as he dresses for a date.  He's
got an aerosol deodorant poised under one arm.  He looks
down at the can, suddenly uncertain.  Could it be...?

INSERT - TV SCREEN - THE JOKER

Lounging beside a full-sized photo of a Jokerized SWIM-
SUIT MODEL -- with GREEN HAIR and CHALK-WHITE FLESH.

		JOKER
	That luscious tan, those ruby lips
	-- and hair color so natural, only
	your undertaker knows for sure!

INT. GOTHAM KITCHEN - THAT MOMENT

A FAMILY in their kitchen, eyeing a 12-inch portable as
MOM serves dinner.  They dig in automatically, then
FREEZE with their forks in midair.

EXT. STREET - SERIES OF SHOTS - NIGHT

DELIVERY TRUCKS, bearing colorful manufacturers' logos,
drive through the city bringing tainted products to
market.

		JOKER (V.O.)
	I know what you're saying.  Where
	can I buy these fine new items?
	-- Well, that's the deal, folks,
	chances are... you've bought 'em
	already!

INT. WAYNE MANOR - STUDY - NIGHT

Bruce tired, is glued to the tube.  Onscreen, the Joker
leers -- gives the camera a BIG JUICY WINK.

		JOKER (V.O.)
	So if you did... remember, put on
	a happy face!!

		MUSIC TAG (V.O.)
		(SINGING)
	Joker Brand.  We're changing the
	face of -- Gooootham!

MUSIC UP.  VIDEO SNOW fills the screen as the jammed
transmission ends.  Alfred ENTERS, adds something to the
folder in front of Bruce.  Bruce reads.

		BRUCE
	Assault with deadly weapon age
	15.  Nice guy.
		(continues looking)
	Psychological testing -- high
	intelligence, unstable, aptitudes
	science, chemistry and -- art.
	Chemistry?

ON BRUCE

He looks at a photo of Napier.

		BRUCE
	Let's go shopping, Alfred.

SERIES OF SHOTS

-- The Gotham Globe cartwheeling INTO FRAME:

		   PANIC GRIPS GOTHAM
	 Contaminated Products Claim 13 Lives
	    WHO IS THE MYSTERIOUS ""JOKER""?

-- An ANCH0RWOMAN on the evening news.  Her complexion
is curiously sallow.  BLACK BAGS show under her eyes.

		ANCHORWOMAN
	... six new deaths, with no clues
	as to the Joker's deadly weapon.

-- An ANCHORMAN with a BIG UGLY ZIT on his nose:

		ANCHORMAN
	-- and what is the pattern?
	Foods, alcohol, or beauty and
	hygiene products.  Cologne,
	mouthwash, underarm deodorant --

-- The original ANCHORWOMAN, whose look is now 100 percent
natural.  Her hair is frizzy.  Her eyebrows are miss-
ing altogether.  Every wrinkle on her face is plainly
visible.

		ANCHORWOMAN
	Or worse yet, there may BE no
	pattern.  The search goes on
	through Gotham's shopping nightmare.

						DISSOLVE TO:

INT. DENT'S OFFICE - DAY

The Mayor is distraught.  Dent is on the phone.

		MAYOR
	We're having this festival if I
	have to carry a shotgun and get
	people there myself.

Dent hangs up.

		MAYOR
	Do you hear the words coming out
	of my mouth, Dent?  The festival
	is ON.  You find out what this
	madman is poisoning us with and
	fast.  DO I make myself CLEAR?

Mayor catches a glimpse of himself in mirror.  Checks to
see that HIS mouth isn't grimacing.

		DENT
	We're working on it.

INT. ARMORY - DAY

Alfred oils a blow gun.  Bruce ENTERS.

		ALFRED
	Oh, sir, did you see the message
	from Miss Vale.  She'll be ten
	minutes late in meeting you at the
	museum.

Bruce puzzles.

		BRUCE
	Am I... I'm not meeting her...?

INT. ALICIA HUNT'S APARTMENT - THAT MOMENT

A bone white hand pats a white cheek.  The Joker's rinsed
his hair black and is applying makeup.  He's done it
before, many times.  He's getting ready for a date.  A
drugged voice intrudes.

		ALICIA (O.S.)
	Jack?  Where are you going?

As he looks up at the mirror, we get a quick glimpse of
Alicia, her face is covered by a shiny white porcelain
doll's mask.

		JOKER
	Daddy's going to make some art.

INT. FLUEGELHEIM MUSEUM - NIGHT

A few PATRONS are viewing paintings in a square, open
atrium, enclosed on all four sides by a BALCONY.  One
story up, overlooking the atrium, there's a TEA ROOM --
an airy, fern-filled dining room popular with tourists.

INT. FLUEGELHEIM - TEA ROOM - NIGHT

Vicki enters with her camera bag and portfolio -- ready
for a confrontation with Bruce.

		  VICKI
	I'm Vicki Vale -- I had a message
	to meet Bruce Wayne here.

		  MAITRE D'
	Yes, he has not arrived.  We have
	a table waiting.

INT. TEA ROOM - NIGHT (TWENTY MINUTES LATER)

Vicki sipping on a gin and tonic, checks her watch.  A
WAITER brings her a small parcel, wrapped in brown paper,
bearing a single word:  URGENT.

		WAITER
	Miss Vale, this just arrived for
	you.

As the WAITER leaves, she tears off the wrapper.  Inside
is a small white box and a NOTE -- SCRIBBLED IN CRAYON.

		      DEAR V. VALE,
		 PUT THIS ON RIGHT NOW.

Vicki opens the box to find a MINIATURE GAS MASK.

A strange HISSING NOISE.  A few feet away, PURPLE SMOKE
billows from air-conditioning vent.

TRAYS OF FOOD CRASH TO THE FLOOR as WAITERS pass out.
ART LOVERS drop forks, go face down in their pasta salad.

Vicki hurriedly fits the gas mask over her nose and mouth.
Within seconds, she's the only one conscious in the room.

INT. MUSEUM - ATRIUM - THAT MOMENT

PURPLE SMOKE plumes up as we TILT DOWN toward the floor
of the atrium.  PATRONS lie sprawled on the floor,
twisted at odd angles, out cold.

The doors BURST OPEN and IN WALKS Joker, looking dapper
in his street makeup and BIG PURPLE POP ARTIST'S HAT.
He is surrounded by his entourage of UGLY GOONS.  One is
carrying a huge GHETTO BLASTER which is thumping out
MUSIC, others are toting battles of champagne and glasses,
and all have cans of aerosol paint sticking out of their
packets.  This is a moving nonstop party.  The Joker
wanders past the artwork examining it with an apprecia-
tive eye.

		JOKER
	Okay, everybody, let's broaden our
	minds.

Stepping over collapsed PATRONS, he stops at ""BLUE BOY""
and holds up a PEARL-HANDLED CANE to get a better
perspective.  Then he pulls a THIN, SHARP SWORD from the
head of the cane and carves a BIG JOKER SMILE in the
canvas.

Manet's barmaid, a Degas ballerina -- all get the Zorro
treatment.  Behind him, his UGLY CRONIES go to work,
spraying paint on every canvas The Joker has missed.

He cocks an eyebrow at Edvard Munch's ""THE SCREAM.""

		JOKER
	I kinda like this one.  Leave it.

INT. TEA ROOM - NIGHT (MOMENT LATER)

Vicki at her table, still wearing the gas mask, scared
as hell.  The Joker saunters over and pulls up a chair.
He is flanked by TWO UGLY HENCHMEN, one carrying a pair
of CANDLESTICKS, the other, the GHETTO BLASTER.

		JOKER
	I think it's safe to take that off.

As Vicki, terrified, removes the gas mask, The Joker
signals to the two UGLY GOONS who swiftly place the
GHETTO BLASTER and CANDLESTICKS on the table and EXIT.

The Joker reaches for his lighter and switches on the
GHETTO BLASTER which produces romantic MUSIC.  A LONG
JET OF FLAME shoots out of the lighter as he lights the
candles.

		JOKER
		(seductively)
	You're beautiful.

		VICKI
		(nervous)
	Thank you.

		JOKER
	In an old fashioned sort of way.
	I'm sure we can make you more --
	today.

The Joker moves his chair a little closer to Vicki.

		JOKER
	THIS your portFOLIO!

		VICKI
	... Yes I'm meeting a friend who
	I wanted to see my work...

He leafs through.  Magazine covers of celebrities, heads
of state and exotic vistas.

		JOKER
	Crap.  Crap.  Crap, crap, craaap
	... Ahhh.  Now here's good work.

The COMBAT PHOTOS from Corto Maltese.

		JOKER
	The skulls.  The bodies.  You give
	it all such a glow.
		(smirking)
	I dunno if it's art, but I like it.

Vicki is squirming, but she doesn't care to argue with
him.

		JOKER
		(with deep sincerity;
		 into Vicki's eyes)
	Let me tell you what I've got in
	mind, Sweetie.  I was in the
	bathtub one day, when I realized
	why I was destined for greatness.
	You know how concerned most people
	are about appearances.  This is
	pretty, that is not.
		(shakes head)
	Well, that's all over for me.  In
	crime the passions ripen fully.
	Now I DO what others only DREAM
	of.  I do art, 'til somebody DIES.
	See???
		(bigger, insane)
	I'm the world's first fully
	functioning homicidal artist!!!

		VICKI
	What do you want?

		JOKER
	I want my face on the one-dollar
	bill!

		VICKI
		(leaning away)
	Good goal.  I take it you're
	joking.

		JOKER
		(suddenly furious,
		 he points to his
		 face)
	DO I LOOK LIKE I'M JOKING?

As quickly as he has flared into rage The Joker calms
down again.

		JOKER
		(charming)
	Look, we mustn't mistake ourselves
	for regular people.  We're ARTISTS.
	For instance, let me challenge you
	with a little piece I did.  Bob,
	Alicia.

He oozes twisted charm.  He's coming on to her.

		JOKER
	You'll make a pictorial record of
	my work.  You'll be with me in the
	avant garde.

		VOICE (O.S.)
	Jack?

ALICIA WANDERS IN, drugged, wraithlike.  She's still wear-
ing the porcelain DOLL'S MASK we saw earlier.

		ALICIA
	You said I could watch you improve
	the paintings.

		JOKER
		(rolling his eyes)
	Oh I'm in trouble now!

Vicki can't take her eyes off this strange figure.

		VICKI
	Why is she wearing a mask?

		JOKER
	Well, she's just a sketch really.
	Alicia!  Come here, have a seat.
	Show the lady why you wear the
	mask.

Alicia sits down numbly and begins to undo the mask.

		JOKER
	You see, Miss Vale, Alicia's been
	made over in line with my new
	philosophy.  Now, like me, she's
	a living work of art.

We're looking at Alicia's profile as the mask comes off.
The side that's turned to us is indeed beautiful.  But
the side we can't see... SENDS Vicki RIGHT OVER THE EDGE.
Vicki lurches out of her seat, knocking it over, HER FACE
FROZEN IN HORROR.

		JOKER
		(modestly)
	I'm no Picasso.  You LIKE IT?

Vicki tips a chair in his path.  Horrified, she tries to
placate him.

		VICKI
	It's great.  But what can I do for
	you?  I...

		JOKER
		(miming it out)
	A little song... a little dance...
	and Batman's head upon a lance.
	Tell me what you know about...

He makes a flapping with his hands indicating Batman.

		VICKI
	I don't know anything about Batman.

		JOKER
		(getting sexy)
	Really, well, what do you think
	about a little 'you and me'?

		VICKI
	I think you're insane.

		JOKER
	I am?  I thought I was a Pisces!
		(brightly)
	C'mon, let's make up.  Here's a
	flower.

There's a BRIGHT PURPLE BOUTONNIERE in his lapel.  He
holds it up for Vicki's inspection as he moves menacingly
closer.

		VICKI
	NO!

The JOKER squeezes a concealed BULB.  A JET OF CLEAR
LIQUID spurts out of the FLOWER, NARROWLY MISSING VICKI.

She GASPS, BUMPS INTO A TABLE.  ACRID BLACK SMOKE rises
from the floor where the clear liquid hit.  Acid.

Vicki backs into a WAITER'S CART.  Her hand closes around
a pitcher.  She FLINGS IT at the JOKER'S HEAD -- DOUSING
HIS FACE WITH WATER.

His hands go up and he doubles over, SHRIEKING, MAKEUP
running through his fingers and onto his suit.

		JOKER
		(like the Wicked Witch
		 of the West dissolving)
	NO!  NO!  I'M MELTING!  I'M
	MELTING!  OH GOD!  I'M MELTING!
	HELP ME!

Vicki is appalled.  She moves towards him.  Her instinct,
in spite of everything, is to help him in his suffering.
As she gets close to him and extends a hand, he leaps up
abruptly, taking his hands from his ""melting"" face, ex-
posing the HIDEOUS RAVAGED MESS beneath the makeup.

		JOKER
		(gleefully)
	BOO!

He advances on Vicki.

And then -- suddenly -- A SKYLIGHT SHATTERS.  A CAPED
SHADOW drops to the floor of the tea-room.  And all at
once, The Joker finds himself face to face with Batman!

On BATMAN's wrist is a STEEL GAUNTLET.  He aims it at
THE JOKER.  The Joker stiffens, thinking he's about to
be shot.  THE BATMAN then fires the gauntlet, the barrel
of which splits in two before sending two metal spikes on
wires in opposite directions, either side of The Joker.

The metal spikes embed themselves in walls on both sides
of the atrium, creating an escape wire for THE BATMAN.
In the wink of an eye he grabs Vicki and plunges over
the balcony, leaving The Joker stunned with amazement.

INT. MUSEUM - ATRIUM - THAT MOMENT

The JOKER'S UGLY GOONS can only gape in awe as Batman and
Vicki swoop past -- swinging across the floor and STRAIGHT
THROUGH AN ARCHED DOORWAY labelled ""EXIT.""

		JOKER
		(recovering)
	Those toys!  Where does he get
	those wonderful toys?
		(to the Goons)
	Well don't just stand there!  GO
	AND ASK HIM!!!!

THE GOONS charge off.

EXT. FLUEGELHEIM - NIGHT (MOMENT LATER)

A SIGN on a black metal stand -- ""CLOSED FOR THE DAY"" --
HURTLES through the glass doors.  Batman and Vicki
HUSTLE THROUGH; he points her to a side alley.  Batman
lobs a SMOKE PELLET into the doorway of the Fluegelheim.

		BATMAN
	GET IN THE CAR!

		VICKI
	WHICH CAR?

Vicki suddenly feels quite stupid.  Because -- while
there are many cars parked along the side alley -- there
is only one BATMOBILE.

		VICKI
	... Oh.

The BATMOBILE is sleek, futuristic, and... well, inde-
scribable.  Vicki climbs in and is dazzled by a stunning
array of electronic gadgetry.

		BATMAN
	Ignition!

As he sprints down the alley, a COMPUTER DISPLAY on the
dashboard registers his unique voiceprint.  A tinny,
synthesized VOICE repeats the command:

		COMPUTER (V.O.)
	Ignition.

The engines are REVVING UP as BATMAN vaults in.

JOKER'S GOONS stumble hacking, coughing, blinded by smoke.
They scatter as the BATMOBILE barrels out of the alley.

Choking GOONS climb into their van and two cars.

EXT. STREET - A MOMENT LATER

The BATMOBILE disappears round a corner in a cloud of
dust.

EXT. STREETS - A MOMENT LATER

PEDESTRIANS scatter as the Joker's two goon cars swerve
hard left and barrel through a crowded intersection.

EXT. STREETS - A MOMENT LATER

BATMOBILE approaches intersection at high speed.  The
right-side indicator begins to flash.  It seems incredible
that at this velocity Batman should think it possible to
make a right-angle turn.  As the BATMOBILE draws level
with the corner a spike with a wire attached to it
rockets out of the side of the vehicle and embeds itself
in a wall.  This enables the BATMOBILE to turn the corner
without slowing down or spinning off across the inter-
section.  Having completed the turn, the wire separates
from the car which continues without losing speed.

INT. BATMOBILE - THAT MOMENT

ONLOOKERS gawk as the sleek supercar rips up the pavement.

		BATMAN
	     Damn!

EXT. BLIND ALLEY - NIGHT

Into a blind alley.  Batmobile doesn't slow down.  Bat-
mobile SPINS ON ITS AXIS 180 DEGREES and goes back where
it came from.

EXT. DOWN ANOTHER STREET - NIGHT

Batmobile moving up on an empty block -- a night construc-
tion team.  A huge piece of heavy machinery backs up
slowly and inexorably, blocking the intersection.

Batman GUNS THE ENGINE.  Swerves left.  Tries to glide
past.  And hits the brakes -- stopping inches short of
a head-on collision with a lamppost!

He jumps out of the car.  No chance to get through.  ON-
LOOKERS and CONSTRUCTION WORKERS cluster around them: the
JOKER'S VAN is two blocks back and coming up fast.

		VICKI
	Can't we --

		BATMAN
	Too many people.  Come on!
		(as she scrambles
		 out)
	SHIELDS!!

The BATMOBILE'S computerized VOICE replies:

		COMPUTER (V.O.)
	Shields.

With a series of CLANGS, CHROME-STEEL PLATES slide into
place -- across the cockpit, over the tires -- leaving
the BATMOBILE an inert, impenetrable BLOCK OF BLACK
METAL.

Batman and Vicki vault over construction debris.

INT. VAN - MOVING - NIGHT

Three police cars, bubbles blazing, overtake the Joker's
van and bear down on the abandoned Batmobile.  The
Joker's van does a U-turn and rumbles sedately off.

EXT. SIDE STREET - NIGHT (THAT MOMENT)

Batman and Vicki zigzag past storefronts and candy stands.

INT. CAR - MOVING - THAT MOMENT

FOUR GOONS with GUNS.  They spot Batman and Vicki coming
off the side street.  The DRIVER shouts into a radio:

		DRIVER
	We got 'em!

EXT. STREET - NIGHT (THAT MOMENT)

Batman and Vicki race down the sidewalk.  The car is
gaining on them.  A SUDDEN SPRAY OF BULLETS shatters a
storefront.

BATMAN'S POV

He sees a RAGAMUFFIN LITTLE GIRL playwalking her doll
around the corner.

He rushes and slides on the street, pulling the girl out
of the way of a HAIL OF BULLETS.

ON LITTLE GIRL

She is wide-eyed.  She holds up the dolly for Batman to
see.

		LITTLE GIRL
	Is it Halloween?

Batman smiles and rushes back to pick up Vicki from
behind a parked car.  The GOONS DRIVE BY AGAIN.  Batman
and Vicki RUN into a BLIND ALLEY.

INT. ALLEYWAY - NIGHT

They watch the Goons glide past the mouth of the alley.
Batman looks up five stories, sees a catwalk.

		BATMAN
	How much do you weigh?

		VICKI
	... A hundred and eight?

He's doing some quick mental calculations when the CAR
reappears -- backing up -- blocking their only avenue
of escape.  Galvanized, Batman unfurls a rope, HEAVES A
BATARANG UPWARD, and grabs Vicki roughly about the waist.

		BATMAN
	HANG ON!

THUGS pile out of the car.  The BATARANG catches on the
catwalk, and Batman triggers the spring-action REEL on
his utility belt.

BULLETS zing past as Batman and Vicki WHIP UPWARD like
fish on a line.  One story; two stories; and then...

They slow.  They STOP.  They DANGLE IN MIDAIR as the
Joker's GOONS advance.  Batman wriggles, twists.  Vicki
SCREAMS.

Her additional weight is too much for the reel mechanism.
They're stranded two stories up -- SITTING DUCKS.

		BATMAN
	Whatever happens -- DON'T LET GO!!

He's detached the reel from his own waist and hitched it
around Vicki's belt.  He LETS GO.

Vicki rockets upward at blinding speed, SHRIEKING all the
way.  Batman, his cape billowing, PLUMMETS DOWNWARD.

Vicki SLAMS up into the catwalk and bobs on the line as
Batman lands with a loud CRASH, overturning a row of
garbage cans.  The GOONS are on him in a flash.  Batman
manages to slam two GOONS into a wall, but before he can
get to his feet, GOON III slams a lead pipe into the back
of his skull.

THUGS circle around him.  The LEAD THUG holds his col-
leagues back, draws his gun, and fires TWO SHOTS, point-
blank, at the yellow-and-black INSIGNIA on Batman's
chest.  The body jerks; they edge closer -- and stop.

		GOON I
	... No blood.

		GOON II
	Jesus.  Who is it?  Check his
	wallet.

		GOON III
	Wait a minute.

GOON III screws up his courage and crouches beside the
body.  He examines THE Batman's TUNIC.

		GOON IV
	What is that?

		GOON III
	Some kind of body armor.

		GOON I
	He's human after all -- Take the
	mask off.

EXT. ROOFTOP - ON VICKI

VICKI has pulled herself up onto a roof.  Down below, the
THUGS are removing Batman 5 cowl.  But at this height --
and this angle -- she can't see his face.  She reaches
for her CAMERA BAG.

ANGLE ON GOONS

Gaping at the shadowed unconscious face of BRUCE WAYNE.
(NOTE:  WE never see his face, and THEY can't either.)

		GOON I
	Get out of the way, I can't see
	him.

And at that very instant... A FLASH GUN EXPLODES OVERHEAD.

Startled, the thugs look up.

		GOON III
	Goddam, it's the girl!

ON VICKI

A chunk of ledge chips off mere inches from her head as
the GOONS OPEN FIRE.  She ducks back behind the overhang,
holds the camera out over the ledge, and KEEPS ON FLASHING
using her telephoto lens.

ON THE THUGS

No sight of Vicki.  They begin to relax a little.

		GOON II
	Did you hit her?

		GOON I
	I think so.  Wax him.

They turn their guns on Bruce.  Ready to FIRE.

A GLOVED HAND snakes out, GRABS GOON I BY THE COATTAIL
and yanks him DIRECTLY INTO THE LINE OF FIRE.  GOON II
has PULLED THE TRIGGER TWICE before he knows what's
happened.

In one fluid motion Bruce HEAVES GOON I's lifeless body
THROUGH THE AIR, knocking GOON II backward over a garbage
can.  GOON II falls and CRACKS HIS HEAD on the nearest
wall.

GOON III takes a rabbit punch to the throat.  On the way
down he catches a STEEL-TOED BOOT in the gut.

Four seconds after all this began, Batman is alone in the
alleyway with GOON IV.

GOON IV has his gun out, but he's shaking too much to
pull the trigger.  Batman smiles.  GOON IV SCREAMS and
RUNS FOR HIS LIFE.

Through all this, Vicki's camera has been poised on the
ledge, snapping away.  Batman looks up.

EXT. ROOFTOP - ON VICKI

She peeks down at the alley.  Limp goons everywhere.
And, in addition, Batman sees her.

ANGLE - ON VICKI

She thinks fast.  She may have a clean photo of Batman's
face.  She removes the roll, drops it down her blouse,
and ESCAPES across the roof.

EXT. ALLEY - ON BATMAN

Batman sees her disappear.  He looks around, spots the
BATMOBILE two blocks away.  The car is still there, the
chrome-steel shields intact.  But DOZENS OF COPS and
CURIOSITY-SEEKERS are SWARMING ALL OVER the fearsome
machine.  Batman snorts in frustration.

Just then, A GIANT THREE-TON CATERPILLAR WINCH rumbles up
the street toward the Batmobile.  He's about to get towed.

He takes a RADIO TRANSMITTER from his utility belt:

		BATMAN
	Shields open.

EXT. STREET - ON BATMOBILE

TWO COPS are crawling along the hood of the car.  From
within they hear the tinny computerized voice:

		COMPUTER (V.O.)
	Shields open.

The steel plates begin to retract.

		BATMAN (V.O.)
		(over radio)
	Ignition.

		COMPUTER (V.O.)
	Ignition.

		COP
	There's somebody in there!

The stunned COPS gaze into the Batmobile's cockpit -- then
TUMBLE OFF THE HOOD as the turbine engines ROAR TO LIFE
and THE BATMOBILE BEGINS TO MOVE.

COPS AND ONLOOKERS quickly clear a path.  They stand there
stunned as the futuristic auto PICKS UP SPEED and advances
toward the end of the block.  The LEFT TURN SIGNAL flashes
dutifully.  And the BATMOBILE VANISHES AROUND THE CORNER.

PANDEMONIUM BREAKS LOOSE as the COPS bolt for their cars.

						CUT TO:

VICKI

running across rooftops, with much fear.  She shimmies
down a ladder, only one roof to go to get to the street
and freedom.  She hears SIRENS.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

SIRENS WAIL.  PASSERSBY STARE SLACKJAWED at the driverless
BATMOBILE as it tears down the street, passing, darting,
dodging buses and CUTTING OFF TAXIS -- all with a squad of
COP CARS in hot pursuit.

ON VICKI

SHE'S COME TO AN OBSTACLE.  It's a five-foot drop to the
street below.  Vicki clambers down KERPLUNK and quickens
her pace, tossing a nervous glance over her shoulder
every couple of steps.

Then suddenly she walks smack into Batman.

		BATMAN
	Not even a 'thank you'?

		VICKI
		(embarrassed)
	Well -- I think you might thank
	me.  You were as good as dead.

		BATMAN
	You weigh a little more than 103.

SIRENS APPROACH.  Batman takes her gently by the
shoulders.

		BATMAN
	You'd better come with me.

		VICKI
	... Where are we going?

No reply.

EXT. ALLEYWAY - NIGHT

Street level.  Batman emerges pulling Vicki.

EXT. ALLEYWAY - NIGHT

Batman sees the BATMOBILE rounding the corner.  With Vicki
in front of him, he STEPS DIRECTLY INTO THE PATH OF THE
ONRUSHING HEADLIGHTS.

		BATMAN
	STOP!

BRAKES SQUEAL.  The BATMOBILE stops one yard short of
Batman and Vicki.  A moment later Batman is AT THE WHEEL.

SIRENS BUILD.  LIGHTS FLASH.  THE COP CARS are now
visible behind them.  Batman floors the pedal; the Bat-
mobile's powerful AFTERBURNERS kick in; and the hapless
cops KILL THEIR SIRENS as BATMAN zooms off into the night
at 140 mph.

						DISSOLVE TO:

INT. BATMOBILE - NIGHT

Batman drives down a deserted stretch of road lined by
ancient tall pines.  Vicki tries to see out.  Batman
pushes a button and changes the polarization of the
glass.  She can't see out.  He's stoic.

		VICKI
	This is kidnapping.

		BATMAN
	Looks like it.

INT. BATMOBILE - NIGHT (MOMENT LATER)

Vicki studies Batman's face.  He flicks a switch on
lights behind his head which dazzle Vicki, making it
impossible for her to see him.

Vicki frowns, looks through the windshield, and SEES --
much to her horror -- an enormous SHEER CLIFF WALL
LOOMING DEAD AHEAD.

Wide-eyed, she looks at Batman.  Still smiling, he HITS
THE GAS -- SPEEDING UP.  She lets out a SCREAM.

ANGLE ON CLIFF WALL

Suddenly the cliff wall VANISHES ALTOGETHER -- revealing,
in its place, the GAPING MOUTH OF AN UNDERGROUND CAVERN.

Batmobile ZOOMS through.  A moment later, the CLIFF WALL
-- which is nothing more than a MIRROR PROJECTION -- winks
back into existence, showing no trace of the cavern.

INT. BATCAVE - NIGHT

Another world -- a vast, dank world of perpetual night,
unchanged by the centuries.

STALACTITES hang from walls.  Cramped, craggy passageways
spiral off maze-like, descending into darkness.

And then -- an incongruous sight:  vast banks of blinking
computers.  A fully-equipped machine shop.  A state-of-
the-art crime lab.  This is THE BATCAVE.

Batman climbs out of the car.  He keeps his distance from
Vicki.  She steps from the Batmobile a little shaky.

DAPPLED POOLS OF LIGHT create an almost operatic stage for
Batman and Vicki to alternately hide and reveal themselves
in.  Vicki steps carefully into the light.  Trying to see
Batman better.

		BATMAN
	Watch your step in here.

Vicki stops just over the edge of a DEEP BLACK PIT.  She
kicks a pebble over.  Long seconds pass; no sound.  She
looks up.  Suspended over the bottomless pit are a pair of
gymnast's rings.  She backs away.

SUDDENLY Vicki's HEAD jerks up abruptly.  In the dim
recesses overhead, BATS ARE SCREAMING.  She shivers.

		VICKI
	Bats.  They're -- terrifying.

		BATMAN
	That's the idea.

Batman pats the cage of a WOUNDED BAT, its wing is
splinted.

		BATMAN
	They're also great survivors.

Vicki steps away, repulsed.

Batman is rustling papers.  She can't see what he's doing.
She begins to examine a row of bat-suits hanging nearby.

		VICKI
	What are these made out of?

		BATMAN
	It doesn't have a name.

While he seems pleased at Vicki's fascination with his
lair, he nevertheless remains guarded.  Vicki moves
toward Batman, intent on getting a close look at him.

		VICKI
	What are you going to do with me?

Batman, realizing what Vicki is trying to do, moves away
from her into shadow.

		BATMAN
	You're going to do something for
	me.

Vicki again begins to approach Batman.  Keeping in shadow,
he moves behind a lab table.  On the table, amid the
beakers and test tubes, are dozens of TAINTED PRODUCTS:
makeup, deodorant, etc.  Nearby, a COMPUTER PRINTER begins
to CHATTER; Vicki watches information scrolling across the
main monitor.

		VICKI
		(looking at the
		 tainted products)
	What is all this?

Batman turns but keeps his face out of the light.

		BATMAN
	The police have got it wrong.
	They're looking for one product.
	It's much bigger than that.  The
	Joker's tainted hundreds of basic
	chemicals at the source.

		VICKI
	But... then whole shipments of
	every product would be poisoned?
	We'd all be dead.

		BATMAN
	No.  Each product only contains
	one component.  The poison only
	works when they're mixed.  Hair
	spray won't do it alone.  But...
	hair spray and perfume and lipstick
	will be toxic and -- Untraceable.

		VICKI
		(impressed)
	How did you figure that out?

No answer.  Batman steps away.

		BATMAN
	Take this to the press.

He hands her a thick envelope.  She looks it over
cautiously.

		VICKI
	I may have some trouble with that.
	A lot of people think you and the
	Joker work together.

		      BATMAN
	Do me a favor.  Don't flatter my
	enemy.  The man's psychotic.

		      VICKI
	Some people say the same about
	you.

This is a new idea to Batman.  He pauses for a moment.

		BATMAN
	What people?

		VICKI
	Well, let's face it, you're not
	exactly normal, are you?

		BATMAN
	It's not a normal world.

Vicki stares at him.  She's suddenly chilled.

		VICKI
		(peering into the
		 darkness)
	Why did you bring ME here?

		BATMAN (O.S.)
		(A BEAT; then from
		 another direction)
	People need that information.

		VICKI
	But you could have just sent it.

She looks around.  Where is he?  NO SOUND.

Suddenly he is near.  She backs up.

		BATMAN
	You're right, I could have.  There
	is something else.

She looks down.  She has backed up nearly to the gaping
hole.

		VICKI
	Wh-at?

		BATMAN
	You have something I want.

Batman suddenly steps very close to her.  She holds her
hand to her breast.

		VICKI
	What could I have that you want?

Batman SWIRLS his cape up over her.

Her eyes widen.  She starts to SCREAM.

He embraces her.  She stops.

And as she closes her eyes -- he produces an AMPULE of
KNOCKOUT GAS which he breaks under her nose.  She slumps.

THE ROOM SPINS.  SOUND OF BATS WINGS.

						DISSOLVE TO:

INT. BEDROOM - AFTERNOON

Vicki AWAKENS.  She feels her face.  Was it a dream?

She steps shakily to the mirror.  Touches her lips.  What
happened?  Did he -- make love to her?  Then she touches
her breast.  NO FILM.

		VICKI
	The film!  He took the FILM!

PHONE RINGS.

		VICKI
	Hell-hello?

		KNOX
	Vicki?  Are you all right?  You
	want me to come over there?

		VICKI
		(seeing something on
		 her table)
	No... Wait.  Allie?

She reaches OUT OF FRAME and brings the envelope Batman
gave her up to the phone.

		VICKI
	Allie, can you still make the
	evening edition if I bring
	something to you?

		KNOX
	Just barely.  Is it hot?

		VICKI
	Yeah it's hot.

		KNOX
	How hot?

She hangs up.

		VICKI
	Very hot.

EXT. NEWSSTAND - DAY

The early edition of the Globe carries the banner
headline:

		    WAR OF THE FREAKS
	 JOKER AND BATMAN CLASH AT FLUGELHEIM

A DELIVERY TRUCK cruises past, dumping a bundle of AFTER-
NOON EDITIONS on the sidewalk.  ""WAR OF THE FREAKS"" has
been relegated to the lower right-hand corner of the page
-- supplanted by more pressing news.

	   BATMAN CRACKS JOKER'S POISON CODE
Citizens told to avoid the following products:

INT. TELEVISION STUDIO - EVENING

The ""ACTION NEWS"" set, with anchor PETER McELROY.

		PETER
	Avoid the following combinations:
	deodorants with baby-powder, hair
	spray, and Odor-eaters.  Safe
	products are flying in as Gotham
	City goes on a forced fast.  And
	all of Gotham is wondering what
	to make of Batman.  Friend or Foe?

INT. AXIS CHEMICALS - EVENING

Joker SCREAMS at the top of his lungs.

		JOKER
	I have given a name to my pain and
	it is BAT MAN!!!

Joker BLASTS the TV with a riot GUN!  OTHER GOONS stare.
Joker charges for the factory.

		JOKER
	Bob, you got to possess strength
	to inflict greater pain!  We got
	a Bat to kill.  And I want to
	clean my claws!!

INT. BATCAVE - NIGHT

Bruce looks at assortment of maps.  He looks tired.
Alfred brings in some coffee.

		ALFRED
		(starting to EXIT)
	Sir, Miss Vale called again.  I
	don't know what you intend to do
	about her.  But I think your
	present course of action may just
	strengthen her resolve.  She's
	quite tenacious.

		BRUCE
		(thinking)
	I know, Alfred.

Alfred heads for the door.  He stops and pulls himself
tall.

INT. VICKI'S APARTMENT - AFTERNOON

A KNOCK at the door -- Vicki opens it and Bruce is
standing there smiling, a flower in his hand, a shoulder
bag on his shoulder, Vicki is very surprised.  She
recovers.  Still cool.

		VICKI
	Well, if it isn't the invisible
	man.

		BRUCE
	You saw through me.

Hands her the flower.  She looks at it warmly.

		VICKI
	Come in.

Bruce ENTERS.  She looks at flower like it could squirt
something on her.  Bruce smiles.  A BEAT of nervous
silence.

		BRUCE
	So...

		VICKI
		(hesitates, then)
	Listen, I know that we're supposed
	to ease into this sort of thing,
	but I'm really perplexed about
	you.

		BRUCE
	Yeah, I know, that's why I came.
	I...

		VICKI
	You lied to me about leaving town.
	You won't return my phone calls.
	Then I saw you march through
	bullets like you were trying to
	commit suicide.

		BRUCE
	Look, I... I did kind of lose it
	for a while.  But some things just
	affect me.

		VICKI
	Affect you?  You were a totally
	different person.

		BRUCE
	You have to understand... crime.
	I... love this city.

		VICKI
	See, now he's back... the sweet,
	caring guy... but you seem to be
	at least two people.  What's going
	on?

Bruce stands and looks out the window.  Torn.

		BRUCE
	Look, Vicki.  There's something
	you should know...

A KNOCK AT THE DOOR interrupts him.  Vicki lingers and
then goes to the door.

Peering through the peephole, she sees a DELIVERY BOY.

		VICKI
	Who's there?

		DELIVERY BOY
	Package for Miss Vale.

DELIVERY BOY hands package in, she signs and shuts door.
Vicki examines the mysterious package.  It's another
brown-paper parcel... ADDRESSED IN CRAYON.

		VICKI
	Bruce, I'm frightened.

Bruce looks at the parcel.  Grabbing his shoulder bag, he
takes package to the kitchen.

		BRUCE
	Shut the door.  Just in case.

		VICKI
	Be careful.  Don't set it off.

She shuts the door.  Leaving Bruce alone in kitchen.

INT. KITCHEN - DAY

Bruce opens his bag and lifts out a false bottom to
reveal his UTILITY BELT.  He removes a tiny ULTRASOUND
SCANNER from the UTILITY BELT -- rather like a stetho-
scope, with a sonar display where the earpieces should be
-- and runs it over the package.

		VICKI (O.S.)
	What do you think?

		BRUCE
	Nothing ticking.

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

Vicki moves next to the door and listens.

INT. KITCHEN - DAY

Bruce takes a small gas mask from his belt, puts it on,
then SLITS THE WRAPPING with a steak knife.  Nothing
happens.

		VICKI (O.S.)
	What's happening?  Are you okay?

She KNOCKS.  He JUMPS.  He's tense.  Bruce carefully
pulls back the flaps.  SUDDENLY the top of the package
BURSTS OPEN.


INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

Vicki JUMPS at the NOISE.

		VICKI
	Bruce, are you all right?

No answer.

		VICKI
	Bruce, I'm coming in.

She grabs for the door and PUSHES THROUGH.

INT. KITCHEN - DAY

Bruce stares at the package.  No utility belt in sight.

		BRUCE
	Very poetic.

ON BOX

-- A GLOVED HAND on a SPRING, holding a BUNCH OF DEAD
FLOWERS, has erupted through the top of the package and
wobbles about.  There is a large EMBOSSED CARD in the
flowers.  Bruce lifts out the card and she reads it.

		VICKI
	'Roses are red, violets are blue,
	these flowers are dead, you could
	be, too.'
		(suddenly very
		 frightened)
	He sent something just before he
	arrived the last time.

Bruce nods her out of there.  Vicki heads for the living
room, but before she can get through the kitchen door,
the Joker, BOB and ONE OTHER GOON BURST THROUGH THE DOOR.

		JOKER
	Miss me?

The Joker sees Bruce and stops in his tracks.

		JOKER
	Well, Ms. Vale, another rooster
	in the henhouse?

The Joker pulls a gun and moves toward Bruce.  He traces
the outline of Bruce's cheek with the gun.

		JOKER
	Tell me something, my friend, you
	ever danced with the devil by the
	pale moonlight?

Bruce is alarmed.  A memory fragment clicks.

		BRUCE
	What?

		JOKER
	I ask that question of all my prey
	before I send a draft through
	their domes.  I just like the sound
	of it.

BOB CHUCKLES.  Bruce is torn, should he fight?  Should he
reveal his identity?  Suddenly he realizes... his utility
belt is sitting in plain view on the kitchen counter!!!
The Joker has yet to notice.  Bruce backs slowly against
the counter, shielding the belt from view.

		JOKER
	Vicki, don't let my happy-go-lucky
	appearance fool you.  I'm really
	very upset.
		(getting angrier)
	You were dining with me!  Talking
	art, I was a man who was getting
	somewhere with a beautiful woman.
	And then ALL OF A SUDDEN, without
	a word of apology, you take off
	with that SIDESHOW PHONY.

He moves closer to her.

		JOKER
		(bizarrely sincere
		 bad poetry)
	I'm only laughing on the outside,
	my smile is skin deep, if you
	could see inside I'm really crying
	you might join me for a weep.

He cups his hand under Vicki's chin.  Bruce CHARGES at
him.

A BACKHAND from a GOON knocks Bruce off his feet.  As he
reels backward, he contrives to knock the UTILITY BELT
off the counter, by sweeping his ARM across it.

Bruce sprawls in a heap in the corner.

IN A FLASH -- Joker points his gun at Bruce and pulls the
trigger.  A tiny flag -- ""BANG!"" -- pops out of the
muzzle, prompting GREAT HILARITY all around.  Joker
HOWLS!  Bruce sweats.

		JOKER
	Came on I want you to shoot some
	snaps.  Make me immortal.  It'll
	be good for you.

BOB hands Vicki her camera and bag and jacket.

A SCREAM FROM OUT IN THE STREET BELOW calls her to the
window.

EXT. STREET BELOW - HER POV - DAY

A police car has run up on the sidewalk.  TWO POLICEMEN
are staggering in the street, grabbing their throats.
A WOMAN runs horrified from the scene..

INT. VICKI'S APARTMENT - DAY

She turns back to the Joker.

		VICKI
	What's wrong with those policemen?

		JOKER
	Looks like they're rethinking
	their spot in the social order.

BOB pulls Vicki OUT THE DOOR, Joker FOLLOWS, pulls the
door to.

ON BRUCE

He leaps up and stuffs the utility belt into shoulder
bag.

SUDDENLY THE JOKER IS THERE

		JOKER
	Listen, Bruce, NEVER rub another
	man's rhubarb!  Get me?

The Joker levels the GUN at Bruce again and FIRES.  This
time a real bullet.  Bruce is thrown back against the
wall as the bullet hits him.

Joker EXITS.

EXT. GOTHAM STREET - DAY

Goons force Vicki into a van.  Joker heads for it, too.

		JOKER
	Gotham Square, lickety split.

INT. VICKI'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

Bruce is coming around. He checks his side, no blood.
He then looks at his shoulder bag, it has a hole in it.
He takes out the utility belt.  It has a bullet embedded
in it.

Bruce struggles up, straps on the UTILITY BELT, dials a
number on its digital pad.  Red lights scan and then
beep.  Bruce RUNS INTO THE BEDROOM.

INT. BEDROOM - DAY

He rummages around for something in her closet.  Finds a
black something and EXITS.

EXT. APARTMENT - HALLWAY - MOMENT LATER

Bruce sprints across the hallway and up a stairway.

EXT. ROOFTOP - DAY (MOMENT LATER)

Bruce bursts onto the roof just in time to see VAN pull
out into the traffic.

He pulls the black nylon ski cap over his head -- and
BOUNDS OFF across the rooftops.

EXT. CROSS STREET - DAY (MOMENT LATER)

The VAN passes by.  PEDESTRIANS staring goggle-eyed at
the rooftops.

Far above them, a MAN -- oddly garbed in a suit, a tie,
a yellow belt and a BLACK SKI MASK -- is gliding across
the intersection on a ROPE.

INT. VAN - THAT MOMENT

The Joker is being thrown around a bit by the speeding,
swerving van.  Suddenly he reaches forward and grabs BOB.

		JOKER
		(violently)
	Slow down, you maniac!

The Joker turns to Vicki, putting his hand on her knee.
She tries to move away from him.

		JOKER
		(sadly, trying to
		 gain her sympathy)
	I'm a little high-strung.  Y'know,
	I've recently had tragedy in my
	life.  Day before yesterday,
	Alicia hurled herself out of the
	window.  Couldn't adjust to my new
	aesthetic.

He hands her a porcelain mask.  It has a crack in it.

		JOKER
	But you can't make an omelette
	without breakin' some eggs!

EXT. INTERSECTION - DAY (THAT MOMENT)

The Joker's VAN GUNS through a red light, just missing a
MOUNTED POLICEMAN standing by his horse.  His horse
shies, rears back, turns in a circle.  THE POLICEMAN,
already in bad shape, struggles with his throat, moving
slow as molasses.  His face contorts into a smile and he
shakes his head slowly.

Bruce lands on horse's back.  COP turns slowly around,
sees Bruce.  Bruce looks with alarm at the policeman.

HIS POV - ANOTHER POLICEMAN

staggers down the street, his hands grasping his throat.
Joker has done his evil work.

EXT. SIDE STREET - MOMENTS LATER

Bruce on horseback, charging past elegant brownstones,
drawing stares from PASSERSBY.  On his belt is a FLASHING
RED SIGNAL LIGHT.

EXT. RIVERVIEW DRIVE - THAT MOMENT

A YELLOW VW BUG rips up the street at 70 mph.

INT. VOLKSWAGEN BUG - THAT MOMENT

We can't see the driver.  But we do see, on the seat
beside him, a VIDEO DISPLAY with a shifting grid map of
the city -- and on it a FLASHING SIGNAL blinking in
perfect sync with the one on Bruce's belt.

EXT. SIDE STREET - THAT MOMENT

Bruce sees the VW bug rounding the corner and streaking
towards him.  He reins in the horse; it rears back on its
hind legs; the BUG pulls up.

-- and Alfred hands Bruce a bundle of Batclothes.

		BRUCE
	Alfred, find the records on my
	family.  I want to check something.

		ALFRED
	Yes, sir.  Be careful.

Bruce, now nearly fully dressed as Batman, gets back on
the horse and RIDES OFF.  Alfred looks pained.

EXT. CENTRAL SQUARE (GOTHAM CITY) - DAY

The square where the unveiling is taking place, has been
closed to traffic.  There are barricades at the entrance
streets.

A temporary stage has been erected around a shrouded
statue on one side of the square.  A SMALL CROWD is
gathered.

OFF TO ONE SIDE - POLICEMAN

crouches in the grass.  TWO PEOPLE try to help him.

CLOSER ON POLICEMAN

He struggles to move his head to look up.  WE SEE:  his
face is contorting into a smile.

BACK AT STAGE

A Junior high school BAND is playing the ""Happy Birthday""
theme.

		MAYOR
		(gushing)
	Happy birthday, Gotham City!  You
	know every city has a father and
	no one could have been a better
	father than John T. Gotham.

The van ENTERS the square and stops.  Joker, flanked by
armed GOONS, gets out, Vicki is pulled along with him.

Joker pushes through the crowd at the bottom of the steps
leading up to the stage.

		MAYOR
	I dedicate the statue of a man
	who embodies the past, present,
	and future of our great city.

Mayor pulls a cord and drops the shroud around the statue
revealing:  Not John T. Gotham.  But:

A GARISH, POLYCHROME STATUE OF THE JOKER wielding two Uzi
machine guns like they were six-shooters.  Expressionism
on acid.

		JOKER
		(excited)
	Start shootin', my sweet.  I'm
	makin' history.

Joker clambers onto the stage.

		JOKER
		(apologetically)
	No autographs.

He seizes the mike from terrified Mayor.  The Joker holds
a small machine gun on him.  Under the grin, he's
grinning.

		MAYOR
	Call the police!

		JOKER
	What police?

ANGLE ON SEVERAL POLICEMEN

lying on grass.

		JOKER
		(supremely
		 confident)
	Hi there, fellow Gothamites!  As
	the NEXT founding father of this
	fair city, I declare these
	celebrations well and truly open.

He FIRES A BURST into the air, knocking down one corner
of the ANNIVERSARY BANNER.  Joker LAUGHS MANIACALLY.

Suddenly, from nowhere, a BAT BOLO ZINGS through the air.
Its heavy ends wrap symmetrically around the head of the
statue.  A HISSING RISES from the bomb-like bolo ends.

Vicki looks up as PEOPLE RUSH away from the stage, PEOPLE
are SCREAMING.

BATMAN - ON TOP BUILDING

FIRING the BOLOS from a crossbow sort of weapon.

Suddenly a BLAST as both ends of the bob EXPLODE and
knock the head of the statue off.  Joker is stunned.

		JOKER
	My very face destroyed!

TWO GOONS FIRE AT BATMAN.

ON BATMAN

He FIRES two lines into the ground and SWINGS down be-
tween them to the stage.  BULLETS FLY AROUND HIM.  TWO
GOONS attack him and he kicks them both down and heads
for Joker.

Joker grabs the Mayor around the neck.  Covers him with
gun.

		JOKER
	DAMN!  I got a good one for you,
	Batman.  What's red and bloody and
	has no brains?

Batman circles Joker.

		JOKER
	I didn't know Bats came out in the
	daytime.

		BATMAN
	Just when murderous clowns leave
	the circus.  Let him go.

		JOKER
	Aw, can't I keep him?  I'll feed
	him.

		BATMAN
	What do you want from this city?

		JOKER
		(thinking aloud)
	I want a new bicycle, I want to
	visit Florida, I want...

ON VICKI

holding up her camera.

		VICKI
	Let me get this, Joker.

He turns to her and poses.  She FLASHES.

Batman takes this occasion to SNAP his finger.

		BATMAN
	Joker!

Joker looks at him.  Batman materializes a Joker card.
Joker looks at it and Batman sucker PUNCHES him in the
face as the Mayor rolls away.

Joker rolls backward and zips to his feet.  He looks
around as GOONS FLEE.

		JOKER
	The odds are even.  So I'm a
	leavin'.  You got your toys --
	I got mine.

Joker steps back onto the statue platform and AMIDST
COLORED SMOKE AND FIREWORKS he DISAPPEARS DOWN into the
sewer system.

Batman spins around.  The goons SPEED AWAY in the van.
Vicki readies her camera to snap Batman.

		BATMAN
	Thanks.

		VICKI
	So we're even.  I don't owe you
	anything.

		BATMAN
	Whatever you say.

Vicki snaps a photo.  Batman looks at her for a beat, a
hint of disappointment.  POLICE SIRENS.  Batman FIRES a
line up to the building and ZOOMS UP the line to the top.
He disappears as Vicki shoots pix.

INT. GOTHAM GLOBE  MORGUE ROOM - DAY

Knox is beside himself.  Vicki is thoughtful.

		KNOX
	... And you didn't have film in
	your camera?

		VICKI
	This goon handed it to me.  I
	didn't check.  Oh, Allie, I'm
	really losing it.

		KNOX
	I found out about your strange
	street corner.

She looks up at him.

		KNOX
	Your friend Bruce is pretty screwed
	up, Vicki.

		VICKI
	More good news?

He motions her to a microfilm reader.  Knox begins
cranking through back-issue newspapers.

		KNOX
	Okay, here we go.  Check it out.

Vicki stares at the screen.  A BANNER HEADLINE reads:

		  THOMAS WAYNE MURDERED
	Prominent Doctor, Wife Slain in Robbery
Unidentified Gunman Leaves Child Unharmed

Beneath it, a PHOTO:  Cops kneeling over corpses.  Medics
with stretchers.  And off to one side, a YOUNG BOY --
BRUCE WAYNE -- his arms wrapped around the waist of a
BEAT COP.

BOY stares at the camera -- a mask of UNFORGETTABLE AGONY.

		KNOX
	Some snap, huh?

		VICKI
		(true horror)
	Oh my God... his parents were
	murdered in that alley.  That's
	why he went there.  It was the
	anniversary of their death.

TIGHT ON YOUNG BRUCE'S FACE

His features recognizable across all the years --
permanently, indelibly traumatized.

BACK TO SCENE

		KNOX
	Yep.  Poor kid watched the whole
	thing happen.

		VICKI
		(deep empathy)
	Allie, the look on his face...
	it's just like that day with the
	Joker in front of City Hall.

		KNOX
	Can you imagine what this could
	do to a guy, Vicki?

TIGHT ON VICKI

She thinks about that.

BACK TO SCENE

		VICKI
		(after a BEAT)
	Allie, does it say... how old his
	father was -- when he was killed?

		KNOX
	Yeah, I noticed that, young guy,
	too... just turned 35 years old.

TIGHT ON VICKI

She makes a connection.

		VICKI
		(knows now but
		 hides it)
	I've got to go.

BACK TO SCENE

Vicki EXITS slowly.

		KNOX
	Don't let your personal feelings
	interfere with your job.

INT. BATCAVE - NIGHT

BRUCE'S BANK OF MONITORS, deep in the Batcave.  Thirty
screens show Wayne Manor's empty rooms.

Bruce is slumped at a table, he's sleeping, head resting
on A MAP OF GOTHAM.  Alfred TIPTOES IN and folds batcape.
Bruce wakes.

		BRUCE
	The file on my parents?

Alfred nods toward it.  He's grave.

		BRUCE
	What's on your mind, Alfred?

		ALFRED
	I'm getting old, Sir.  And I don't
	want to fill my days grieving for
	old friends.  Or their sons.

EXT. CITY HALL - DAY

The steps are packed with TV NEWS CREWS.  The MAYOR,
flanked by JIM GORDON and HARVEY DENT, steps gloomily to
a podium.

		MAYOR
	The 200th Anniversary Birthday
	Gala has been indefinitely
	postponed.

EXT. CITY HALL - THAT MOMENT - DAY

TECHNICIANS in VIDEO TRUCKS, watching on remote monitors.

		DENT (V.O.)
	We're vehemently opposed to
	terrorism in any form.  But a
	toxin has been found in the coffee
	at the police station.  With two-
	thirds of our police force
	disabled we simply can't guarantee
	public safety --

INSERT - TELEVISION MONITOR - THAT MOMENT

VIDEO NOISE wipes half the image away, leaving a SPLIT
SCREEN.  On one side is the MAYOR.  On the other --
sitting in a director's chair with a big yellow HAPPY
FACE behind him -- is THE JOKER.  But a very DIFFERENT
Joker indeed.  Relaxed and very lucid.  With his flesh-
colored makeup on he manages to make his grin almost
friendly.

		JOKER
	Joker here.
		(standing up)
	Now you guys have said some pretty
	mean things.  Some of which I
	admit were true under that fiend
	Boss Grissom.  He was a terrorist
	and a thief.  But on the other
	hand he was great at Bridge.
	Anyway he's dead and he left me in
	charge.  Now I CAN be theatrical,
	maybe even a bit rough -- but
	there's one thing I'm not.  I'm
	NOT a killer.  I'm an artist.
		(big grin)
	And I looove a party.  So truce.
	COMMENCE AU FESTIVAL!

He spreads his arms to a torrent of CANNED APPLAUSE.

		JOKER
	I even got a little present for
	Gotham City.  At midnight I drop
	20 million dollars cash on the
	crowd.  I've got plenty so don't
	worry about me.

		MAYOR
	We are not prepared to discuss
	any deals...

		JOKER
		(interrupting)
	You heard me, folks -- $20 million!

SERIES OF IMAGES OF CITIZENS

Ears prick up.  They are very interested.

		JOKER
	And there will be entertainment.
	The BIG FIGHT.  Me in one corner,
	and in the other, the man who has
	brought the real terror to this
	city.  BATMAN.

ON MAYOR AND DENT

They look at each other in surprise.

		JOKER
		(leaning in to CAMERA;
		 to Batman)
	Can you hear me!  Just you and me.
	Mano A Mano.  I've taken off my
	makeup, let's see if you can take
	off yours.

INT. WAYNE STUDY - EVENING

Bruce stares at TV.  Shuts it OFF.  He takes deep regular
breaths.

CLOSER ANGLE

He pulls out a police file.

ON SOUND TRACK

-- A MEMORY SOUNDS FROM THE PAST float by -- A SNATCH OF
MUSIC.  A WOMAN'S LAUGHTER.

ON FILE

Bruce opens a file ""POLICE REPORT.  UNSOLVED"" is written
across the cover.

He turns the page and the POLICE PHOTOS FALL OUT.  He
picks one up.

A WASH OF MEMORY SOUND floods the screen.  STREET NOISES.
A LITTLE BOY'S VOICE.

ON PHOTO

The shocked-sad face of the little boy that terrible night.

MEMORY SOUND WASHES LOUDER.  QUICKER FOOTSTEPS.  A VOICE.

		BRUCE'S MOTHER (V.O.)
	Tom, there's someone following us!

						CUT TO:

BRUCE'S MEMORY - EXT. GOTHAM STREET - NIGHT (1963)

THOMAS, MARTHA and the young BRUCE WAYNE are running
TOWARDS us.  Something stops them.

						CUT TO:

BRUCE'S POV

We see TWO YOUNG HOODLUMS pointing a gun AT us.  The
HOODLUM with the gun grabs the string of pearls on
Martha's neck.  Thomas tries to grab the young HOOD's
arm.  We hear the SOUND OF A SHOT.  Thomas falls.  Martha
SCREAMS.  The HOOD FIRES -- Martha falls.  The second
HOODLUM runs away.

The HOODLUM points the gun AT the CAMERA.  The HOODLUM'S
FACE IS IN THE DARK.

						CUT TO:

YOUNG BRUCE

staring back.

		  JACK (V.O.)
		(distorted by time)
	Tell me, Kid...

The Hood steps into the moonlight.  It is clearly a young
Jack Napier.

		  YOUNG JACK NAPIER
	You ever danced with the devil
	by the pale moonlight?

ON TRIGGER FINGER

-- It squeezes.  Suddenly a VOICE calls out.

		OTHER HOOD (V.O.)
	C'mon... let's go.

						CUT BACK TO:

YOUNG BRUCE'S POV

Where we see Jack begin to move slowly away.  He LAUGHS
as HE LEAVES.

INT. STUDY - EVENING

CLOSE ON Bruce's tortured face -- his eyes snap open.
He is breathing heavily and pouring with sweat.

		BRUCE
	It was him.

		VICKI (O.S.)
	Are you alright?

Bruce starts.  He turns to see Vicki standing there.
Alfred is near the door, having let her in.

		BRUCE
	Wh... how did you get in here?

Alfred EXITS.  Vicki pours herself a drink.  She's a
little nervous.

		VICKI
	Alfred.  Am I crazy?  That wasn't
	just another 'night' for either of
	us.  Was it? We got to each other.
	Didn't we?

Bruce gathers himself and shuts the police folders.

		VICKI
	You were going to tell me
	something at my apartment... when
	the Joker came?  What was it?

Bruce looks away.

		VICKI
	Why won't you let me in?

He looks straight into her heart.

		BRUCE
	You got in.

Vicki looks startled.  My God... he loves her.  The
dilemma fills in the space between them.

		VICKI
	I don't know how to think about
	all this.

		BRUCE
	You said you got to a place where
	you just had to live with the way
	you were.  Well that's this place.

		VICKI
	I loved you every night since
	I met you.  But I don't know if I
	can love you dead.

		BRUCE
	I can't help you out with that.
	I've been trying to avoid this.
	But that's the way it is.  I wear
	a cape.  You take pictures.  It's
	not a perfect world.

		VICKI
	It doesn't have to be a perfect
	world.  I've just got to know if
	we're gonna try to love each
	other.

Bruce stops and looks at her.  Vicki at him.  He can't
commit.

		BRUCE
	He's out there tonight, and now I
	gotta go to work.

Bruce DISAPPEARS into the dark.

SERIES OF SHOTS

THEME MUSIC UP.

Bruce prepares for a final confrontation with the Joker.

The gloves.  The boots.  The cape.  And finally, the
black bat-emblem, framed in yellow, FILLING the SCREEN.

						DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. AXIS CHEMICAL - NIGHT

A big yellow moon.  The wheels of a truck.

TILT UP TO -- sign AXIS CHEMICAL WORKS.  Huge steel gates
CLOSE.

Opposite the gate, the headlights of the BATMOBILE come on.
Its ENGINES ROAR, shooting clouds from multiple exhausts.
Front fender extends as vehicle ROARS down the street.

GOON GUARD jumps for his life as the BATMOBILE, head-
lights blazing, SMASHES through gates, coming to rest in
front of the steel doors of main building.

		GATE GUARD
	It's Batman!

Flaps on the wings of the BATMOBILE open as the GATE
GUARD FIRES his pistol at the car.

Rocket launchers emerge through the open flaps.  Guard's
bullets BOUNCE off BATMOBILE's bodywork.

The ROCKETS IGNITE AND BLAST OFF to demolish the
shuttered steel doors.  Gate guard RUNS OFF.

The rocket launchers retract.  BATMOBILE moves through
hole in doors.

INT. AXIS CHEMICAL - THAT MOMENT

Goons inside take cover as BATMOBILE cruises through
the shattered doors and stops.  They OPEN FIRE with
MACHINE GUNS.  One or two of the bullets CRASH through
the WINDSHIELD.

EXT. BATMOBILE - THAT MOMENT

Batmobile slowly shields itself.  Hunkering down like an
iron butterfly.

ON GOONS

They peer at it.  FIRE WILDLY to no effect.

ON BATMOBILE WHEELS

From the hubcaps come arms.  Each holding a wicked
looking cache of plastic explosives.  GOONS don't SEE IT.

INT. BATMOBILE - THAT MOMENT

From within the cockpit we see: under the facia, a
monitor, flashing a countdown.  12.11.10.  We ZOOM INTO
the monitor as the numbers flick from 10 to 9.

						CUT TO:

INT. BATMOBILE - THAT MOMENT

The MONITOR beneath the facia of the BATMOBILE as it
reads DETONATE.

						CUT TO:

EXT. AXIS CHEMICAL - THAT MOMENT

The Axis Chemical PLANT EXPLODES like a ball of fire.

EXT. AXIS CHEMICAL - ANOTHER ANGLE

Debris and dust fall to earth.  The building is devas-
tated.  Flattened.  Nothing could have lived through the
blast.  A BEAT.  SILENCE. Suddenly from within the
burned rubble -- A RUMBLE.

CLOSER - ON DEBRIS

Something stirs, lifts, moves up and then out, slowly,
the Batmobile pulls itself out of the debris.

EXT. AXIS CHEMICAL - NIGHT

BATMOBILE drives up to the gate.  From out of the dark-
ness Batman steps and pats it on the fender.  It CHUGS.

SOUND OF CHOPPER -- bright search lights flash on Batman.
BULLETS FLY all around him.  He jumps behind steel gate.

EXT. AXIS CHEMICAL - WIDER

A CHOPPER ROARS up from behind a building.  LOUDSPEAKER
BLASTS.

		JOKER (V.O.)
	Not even close!  NO CIGAR, fool!

ANOTHER ANGLE - CLOSE ON JOKER

from the open side door of a chopper.  He's delighted.

		JOKER
	I'm going to the festival.  You
	really ought to show up.  I'm
	gonna kill a thousand people an
	hour until you do.

LAUGHTER as the chopper banks sharply and FLIES OFF
over the river toward the searchlights of the festival.

						CUT TO:

INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT (THAT MOMENT)

A lone WATCHMAN reads in a chair.  The LIGHTS WINK OUT.

-- and a THUG clubs him from behind.  A SMALL ARMY OF
CRIMINAL SHOCK TROOPS ENTERS.  Lights relight.

SEARCHLIGHTS, mounted on trucks with portable generators.
Behind the trucks:  gaudy PARADE FLOATS -- and enormous
deflated BALLOONS, hanging limply from rafters.

Joker's men inflate BALLOONS.  STEEL DOORS rise; the
BEACON TRUCKS RUMBLE out onto the street.  Joker STEPS
INTO the warehouse.

		JOKER
	I'm prepared to rule the world!!

EXT. DOWNTOWN GOTHAM (BROAD AVENUE) - THAT MOMENT

The main street, Broad Avenue, leading into the central
square.  Groups of CAUTIOUS PEDESTRIANS.  AMPLIFIED ROCK
MUSIC as a truck with searchlights rounds a corner onto
Broad Avenue.

Searchlights play up the street and onto the buildings.
A beam illuminates A GIGANTIC BALLOON WITH A HUGE
CARTOON FACE looking round the corner before entering
the Avenue.

This balloon is moored to a parade float.  More trucks
with searchlights, floats and giant balloons FOLLOW.
Cartoon characters and historical figures.  Banners
proclaim; HAPPY BIRTHDAY GOTHAM CITY.

BYSTANDERS are amazed.

Suddenly THE AIR IS FILLED with thousands of dollar
bills.

From the face of the leading balloon (a huge, grotesque,
clown smiling ghoulishly and dressed in white Pierrot
frills) we TILT DOWN THROUGH the swirling dollars.

Here, on a float, surrounded by armed GOONS, sitting on
a giant throne, is the Joker.

Bob hands the Joker bundles of dollar bills.  Joker
pitches the bills, with a grand gesture, up into the
wind from a giant fan.  People grab for the greenbacks
as they fill the air.

TIGHT ON BILL

A REAL one-dollar bill.

WIDER

Like a demonic D.J. the Joker is LIP-SYNCHING TO WHAT-
EVER SONG is BLARING OUT over the SPEAKERS.

PEOPLE flock in from the side streets.  Soon the whole
area is packed with CITIZENS scrambling for dollar bills.

EXT. SIDE STREET - THAT MOMENT

Vicki's taking photographs of the hysterical CITIZENS.

		JOKER (V.O.)
		(amplified)
	Welcome, everyone.  Enjoy yourselves.
	Open those hungry wallets!

He LAUGHS.

A HORN BLARES.  Vicki glances nervously around and is
relieved to see Knox lean out of his car.

		KNOX
	Vicki!

VICKI scrambles into the car.

INT. KNOX'S CAR - SIDE STREET - MOMENT LATER

		KNOX
	You think Batman will show for
	this?

		VICKI
	He'll be here.

EXT. SIDE STREET - THAT MOMENT

Knox DRIVES OFF to join the parade.

						CUT TO:

EXT. GOTHAM CITY - AERIAL SHOT - NIGHT

The city on its island, DARK except for the search-lights
lining Broad Avenue.

All at once, a STREAKING BLACK SHADOW ENTERS FRAME...
THE BATWING!  A phenomenal ULTRALIGHT AIRCRAFT, swift and
sleek, it slices through the night, carrying its pilot on
a final mission of mercy -- and vengeance.

ANGLE ON BATMAN

In the cockpit, Batman, his jaw set, shifts the joystick
and banks the BATWING.

EXT. AERIAL SHOT - BATWING OVER GOTHAM CITY - NIGHT

The BATWING banks away FROM the CAMERA and dives towards
the blacked-out city.

						CUT TO:

EXT. BROAD AVENUE - THAT MOMENT

MAYHEM continues with dollar bills still flying about and
crowds of PEOPLE still chasing them, fighting and
looting.

We see Knox' s car join the back of the parade.

INT. KNOX'S CAR - THAT MOMENT

Vicki is taking pictures of everything in sight.  But
she's clearly looking for Batman.

		KNOX
		(looking up ahead)
	Look at that!

		VICKI
		(snapping away)
	Pull over.

EXT. BROAD AVENUE - KNOX AND VICKI'S POV - THAT MOMENT

Where we see that one of the floats has mounted the side-
walk, crashed into a lamp standard and come to a halt.
The Goons on board are fighting off the crowds of people
who are chasing the dollar bills which have lodged on the
float.

						CUT TO:

INT. KNOX'S CAR - THAT MOMENT

Knox pulls over to the side of the Avenue while Vicki
continues taking pictures.

		KNOX
	Man, this is sick!

Vicki opens the car door and begins to climb out to get
better shots.

		KNOX
	A girl could get hurt in a place
	like this.

EXT. BROAD AVENUE - THAT MOMENT

Vicki leans against Knox's car and looks up to see a
giant balloon of a grotesque UNDERDOG bouncing against
the side of a building.  (This is the balloon which is
attached to the crashed float.)

Vicki whips out her telephoto lens, and is adjusting the
zoom when she does a double take, looks through the lens
again -- and sees.

						CUT TO:

VICKI'S POV OF UNDERDOG THROUGH LONG LENS - THAT
MOMENT

WE SEE, fixed to the underside of the balloon, a number
of metal cylinders.  One of them, damaged by hitting the
side of the building, is beginning TO LEAK A VILE-LOOKING
GREEN GAS.  The heavy gas drops groundward.

						CUT TO:

EXT. BROAD AVENUE - CRASHED FLOAT - THAT MOMENT

GOONS also spot leak and don gas masks.  The green gas
arrives at street level.

Two unfortunate CITIZENS begin to choke, their faces
paralyzed into rictus grins.  One of them appears to drop
dead.

Forty yards away, Vicki panics.

		VICKI
	Those balloons are full of Smylex
	gas!  He's going to kill everybody!

Knox tries to drag Vicki back into the car.

		KNOX
	Get in!  Close the door.

At that moment we hear, through the parade music, the
SOUND OF THE BATWING overhead.  Vicki looks up.

						CUT TO:

VICKI'S POV OF BATWING - THAT MOMENT

The BATWING, lower than before, swoops between the
skyscrapers.

CLOSE SHOT OF BATWING COCKPIT - THAT MOMENT

Batman, at the controls, looks at Broad Avenue below.

EXT. BROAD AVENUE - THAT MOMENT

		VICKI
	We've got to cut those balloons
	loose.  I think I saw Batman.
	We've got to warn him.

Knox drags Vicki into car and SLAMS the door.

INT. KNOX'S CAR (BROAD AVENUE) - THAT MOMENT

Knox thinks for a moment before coming to a decision.

		KNOX
	Don't move.

He JUMPS OUT.

		VICKI
		(trying to stop him)
	Allie...

He runs round to the trunk, opens it and returns with a
tool box.  He takes out a pair of metal cutters and a
cheap anti-dust mask.

		VICKI
	What are you doing?

		KNOX
	Stay here!  Let me do this one
	thing.

		VICKI
	Allie, please... be careful.

Knox puts on the mask.  With the metal cutters in his
hand, he races towards the crashed float.

EXT. CRASHED FLOAT (BROAD AVENUE) - MOMENTS LATER

Nobody is paying attention to the few people affected by
the gas.  Knox LEAPS ONTO the crashed float.  Before the
Goons have even noticed that he's there, he's cut through
one of UNDERDOG's moorings.

ANGLE ON UNDERDOG

As one, now free, corner of the balloon floats up between
buildings.

A Goon FIRES at Knox.  Knox ducks, but then is hit.

Knox's CAR SCREECHES UP.  Vicki flings open the door,
grabs Knox by the collar, and DRIVES AWAY, dragging Knox
with her.

The Goons SHOOT after them.  Holes appear in Knox's car
and most of the WINDOWS are SHOT OUT, but the car makes
it round a corner and off Broad Avenue before the ENGINE
CUTS OUT.

Vicki drags Knox into a SHELTERED DOORWAY next to Gotham
Cathedral.

Blood flows down Knox's face from a minor head wound.  He
looks at her.

		VICKI
	You were great, Allie.  Don't try
	any more heroics tonight.

Knox goes unconscious.

EXT. AERIAL SHOT - BATWING HIGH OVER CITY

The Batwing approaches over tops of the skyscrapers.

ANGLE ON BATMAN - THAT MOMENT

Batman looks up ahead towards avenue.

BATMAN'S POV OF BROAD AVENUE - THAT MOMENT

The light from the constantly shifting searchlights
beams up from deep canyon of high buildings.

We see Joker's giant balloon procession bobbing eerily.
The Batwing slips past the Cathedral tower and begins its
descent down Broad Avenue.

EXT. AERIAL SHOT - ANGLE ON BATWING - THAT MOMENT

From behind the Cathedral, the Batwing levels out for its
first pass over the parade.

BATMAN'S POV OF PASS OVER BALLOONS - MOMENTS LATER

Searchlights flash into the cockpit.  The buildings of
Broad Avenue RACE PAST as the BATMAN sees the LUMINOUS
GREEN GAS leaking from one of the tanks.

EXT. JOKER ON HIS THRONE - THAT MOMENT

The Joker still graciously dispensing dollar bills.

		JOKER
	That's right, folks.  Who can you
	trust?  Me, I'm here handing out
	real money.  And where is Batman?
	He's at home washing his tights!

LAUGHING.  Suddenly he hears the BATWING, looks up.  He
waves and leaps up and down with excitement.

		JOKER
		(screaming into the microphone)
	Ah wing-ed battle flies through the
	night and finds me READY!

The Joker LAUGHS CRAZILY.

Joker.

the fan.

	What is this stuff?

TIGHT ON MONEY

A hand rubs the green dye off and we see underneath.
JOKER MONEY, with JOKER'S FACE on the one-dollar bill.

BACK TO SCENE

		CROWD
		(CHORUS OF ANGER)
	This stuff is fake!

The Joker LAUGHS HYSTERICALLY.

		JOKER
		(through microphone)
	Now comes part where I relieve you,
	the little people, of the burden
	of your failed and useless lives.
	But as my plastic surgeon always
	said, when you got to go, go with
	a SMILE!

Joker takes a remote control device from under his
throne, points it up at the balloons and presses a
trigger.

ANGLE ON GIANT BALLOON - THAT MOMENT

The hanging tanks begin to release gas into the balloons
in response to the Joker's switch.  The balloon swells.

The CROWD PANICS AND TRIES DESPERATELY TO ESCAPE.

along one of the seams.

ANGLE ON FRONT OF MOVING BATWING - THAT MOMENT

From under the front of cockpit a cable catcher/cutter
slides out to protrude in front of the Batwing.

THE CAMERA TILTS DOWN to show the underside of the
Batwing.  We now see the cable catcher/cutter open like
scissors and lock into facing slots on either side of the
catamaran-type fuselage.

AERIAL SHOT - BATMAN'S FORWARD POV

AS HE SWOOPS UNDER BALLOONS.  The Batwing ZOOMS beneath
balloons.  The ropes securing the balloons to the floats
are coming AT us fast.

ANGLE ON CABLE CATCHER/CUTTER - MOMENTS LATER

The cable catcher/cutter is picking up, cutting and hold
ing balloon ropes at a fast rate.

	balloons!

ANGLE ON BATMAN - MOMENT LATER

Batman reacts to something directly ahead of him.

AERIAL SHOT - BATMAN'S POV - THAT MOMENT

He's heading straight for the Cathedral tower.  He lifts
the nose of the Batwing, ENGINE SCREAMING in protest.
Batman banks the aircraft to the right and misses the
Cathedral, by inches.

Forced against the side of the cockpit by the ""G"" forces.
His face is distorted.

	WHY DIDN'T SOMEBODY TELL ME

JOKER SHOOTS BOB.  Other Goons look fearful, fall silent.

		JOKER
	Wage war you BASTARDS!

The Goons quake.  Joker hears WHINE of the BATWING.

AERIAL SHOT - BATWING - THAT MOMENT

CHANGES DIRECTION.  The Batwing flies past, loops, and
returns in the direction from which it came.

Flaps open on the fuselage and wing of the Batwing.  A
laser gun, gatling, missiles and spotlight emerge.

missile sights.

AERIAL SHOT OF BATWING - THAT MOMENT

The Batwing, with all its weapons primed, descends.

EXT. BROAD AVENUE - THAT MOMENT

Goons glance at each other and begin to run away.

The Joker stares at the retreating Goons in disbelief.

		JOKER
	It's just cookin' good, you
	SCHMOES!  What's going ON?

Deserted by Goons, he looks up at Batwing.  Batwing's
spotlights come on as it speeds towards him.  Joker
LAUGHS, steps into the middle of the Avenue, and opens
his arms.

		JOKER
	Come to me you gruesome son of a
	bitch!!!

EXT. BROAD AVENUE - THAT MOMENT

Vicki arrives just in time to see the action.

INT. BATWING - THAT MOMENT

Batman OPENS UP with everything, and we see the GATLING,
MISSILES and LASER EXPLODE INTO ACTION.

EXT. ANGLE ON JOKER - MOMENT LATER

A rocket, bullets, and the laser beam SMASH into the
street, all around the Joker.  He leaps, LAUGHING, into
the air and, miraculously, avoids being hit.

ANGLE ON BATWING - MOMENT LATER

The Batwing levels in for the kill, GUNS, MISSILES,
LASER, all BLASTING away.

ANGLE ON JOKER - THAT MOMENT

The Joker sneers and starts to draw a gun from his belt.
But he goes on drawing it.  On and on.  Finally, he bran-
dishes the entire weapon.  It's a very long barrel.

The Joker takes aim.  The GUN GOES OFF WITH A GREAT
EXPLOSION and a tongue of flame.  The recoil throws the
Joker backwards.

INT. BATWING COCKPIT - MOMENT LATER

The cockpit begins to fill with smoke, blinding Batman.
The ENGINES COUGH AND CUT OUT.

EXT. BROAD AVENUE - THAT MOMENT

Vicki sees the Batwing's in trouble.  She runs after it.

Everything is vibrating, the joystick comes loose in
Batman's hands.  Smoke fills the cockpit.

EXT. BROAD AVENUE - THAT MOMENT

The Joker, clutching his smoking pistol, ducks down as
the stricken Batwing careens over his head.  He dances a
victory jig.

ANGLE ON BATWING - THAT MOMENT

The Batwing belly-flops onto the street and bounces,
spewing black smoke and debris.

It bounces again and begins to cartwheel.

INT. BATWING COCKPIT - THAT MOMENT

Batman blows the perspex canopy off the cockpit, releas-
ing some of the smoke.  Flames shoot from the control
panel.

The Batwing rolls over, throwing Batman around.

BATMAN'S POV - THAT MOMENT

The Cathedral spins as the Batwing hurtles towards it.

EXT. CATHEDRAL STEPS - MOMENT LATER

BATWING SMASHES into Cathedral steps and stops.  COMPLETE
SILENCE.  Then Joker's LAUGH ECHOES down Broad Avenue.

ANGLE ON JOKER - THAT MOMENT

Joker's doubled up with laughter.  Tears down his cheeks.

But forming around him is AN ANGRY CROWD.  He looks up
at it and LAUGHS even harder.

ANGLE ON BATMAN - THAT MOMENT

Batman, dazed and hurt, is trying, with difficulty, to
free himself from the smouldering, twisted wreckage of
the cockpit.

ANGLE ON JOKER AND CROWD - THAT MOMENT

The crowd is pressing in on Joker.  Gordon ARRIVES with
SMALL POLICE FORCE.  Joker pulls out another GUN and
FIRES in the air.  He backs off quickly down the street.

EXT. CATHEDRAL STEPS - MOMENT LATER

Joker ARRIVES to see wreckage.  No movement inside.
Suddenly the BATWING EXPLODES.  Knocking Joker head over
heels.

Joker stands up, looking at burning wreckage and sees
distant crowd coming toward him.

EXT. CATHEDRAL  STEPS - MOMENT LATER

The Joker scurries up to the top of the steps.

EXT. TOP OF CATHEDRAL STEPS - MOMENTS LATER

The Joker takes a walkie-talkie from his pocket.

		JOKER
	Gotham Cathedral tower.  It's
	getting crowded down here.  Come
	and get me in five minutes.

		VOICE (V.O.)
		(over radio)
	Roger, boss.

He looks up towards the absurdly high tower.

		JOKER
	Better make it ten.

The Joker ENTERS the Cathedral.

EXT. BATWING WRECKAGE - MOMENTS LATER

Vicki comes upon wreckage.  Suddenly Batman lifts up from
the smoking metal.  He's shaken and his cape is torn and
caught.

		VICKI
	Are you all right?

Batman gathers himself like thunder.  Total galvanizsed
focus on the cathedral and Joker inside.

		VICKI
	I'll get you out of here.

POLICE CARS approaching, SIRENS BLARING.

		BATMAN
		(pointing to a large
		 chunk of metal
		 tethering his cape)
	Kick that!

Vicki kicks it.  The cape is free.  Batman walks by her
like a knight from hell.

INT. CATHEDRAL - MOMENTS LATER

Suddenly -- framed in the arched doorway -- A RAGGED
BLACK GHOST.

Batman closes the Cathedral door.  He pulls a heavy bar
over the door.  He stops and listens.  He shuffles for-
ward, falls down a step, and crashes against the rear pew,
knocking it over.  The pew falls and all the pews go down
like dominoes, making a LOT OF NOISE.

Before the front pew has fallen, the Joker darts out from
behind it and runs, LAUGHING, into the belltower.

		JOKER (O.S.)
	Missed me.  Hee hee.

Batman sets off in painful pursuit.

INT. BOTTOM OF BELLTOWER STAIRS - MOMENTS LATER

Batman reaches the bottom of the stairs leading up the
belltower and collapses against the bannisters.  Above
him he can hear the Joker's RECEDING FOOTSTEPS on the
CREAKING, rotting STAIRS.

Batman sets his jaw, takes a couple of deep, painful
breaths, and hauls himself up the wooden stairs.

EXT. CATHEDRAL STEPS - THAT MOMENT

COMMISSIONER GORDON with a few POLICEMEN rush to
Cathedral door.

INT. BELLTOWER STAIRCASE - ANGLE ON JOKER - THAT MOMENT

We see the JOKER's feet climbing the stairs, faster and
faster, as he races up the spiral staircase.

INT. BELLTOWER STAIRCASE - ANGLE ON BATMAN - THAT MOMENT

Lower down the stairs we see Batman climbing, slower and
slower -- somehow he keeps going.

INT. BELLTOWER STAIRCASE - ANGLE ON JOKER - MOMENTS
LATER

The Joker, slightly out of breath, comes bounding up
toward the CAMERA, grinning and chuckling, heading for
the belltower itself, where the bells are housed.

INT. BELLTOWER STAIRCASE - ANGLE ON BATMAN - THAT MOMENT

Batman, too, moves up toward the CAMERA, but very slowly.
He looks dreadful.  He turns a corner and looks up.

INT. BELLTOWER STAIRCASE - ANGLE ON JOKER - MOMENT LATER

The Joker reaches the top of the stairs and a wooden
ceiling.  There is a trapdoor set in the ceiling directly
above the stairs.

The Joker, hearing something from below, leans over the
handrail, looks down the stairwell and listens.

INT. BELLTOWER STAIRWELL - JOKER'S POV - THAT MOMENT

We see the staircase spiralling down into the gloom and
hear the sound of COMMISSIONER GORDON and his POLICE
SQUAD as they ENTER the belltower and begin to climb the
stairs.

INT. BELLTOWER STAIRWELL - ANGLE ON JOKER - MOMENT LATER

The Joker opens the trapdoor and climbs into the moonlit
belfry.

INT. BELFRY - MOMENTS LATER

Joker EMERGES through the trapdoor into the belfry.  Tall
louvred ""windows"" on each side designed to protect the
bells but let out sound.  Openings in each wall lead out
onto a parapet which runs all the way round the tower.

In the middle of the belfry a giant bell sits rusting on
its rocker-beds.  Two other, smaller, rocker-beds are
empty.  The bells from these are sitting on the floor
beside the trapdoor.

The Joker casually squirts one of the holding pins on the
bell with his acid flower, it begins to burn as he walks
forward and looks at his watch nonchalantly.  The BELL
behind him BREAKS, SMASHING down from the tower.

INT. BELLTOWER STAIRCASE - ANGLE ON BATMAN - MOMENTS
LATER

Batman flattens himself against the wall as the bell
plummets past bringing pieces of staircase with it.
Batman nearly falls with the bell.

INT. BELLTOWER STAIRCASE - ANGLE ON GORDON AND POLICE

As the SOUND OF BREAKING STAIRCASE gets CLOSER GORDON and
the POLICE run down the stairs.  They are quickly fol-
lowed by the bell and a mass of broken, rotten, dusty
timber.

INT. BELLTOWER STAIRCASE - ANGLE ON BATMAN - MOMENTS
LATER

Batman claws up stairs and collapses just under the
closed trapdoor of the belfry.  He tries to open the
trapdoor but doesn't have the strength.

INT. BELFRY - THAT MOMENT

Joker paces, impatiently waiting for his rescue heli-
copter.  Glances at his watch.

INT. BELLTOWER STAIRCASE - ANGLE ON BATMAN - THAT MOMENT

Batman, beneath the trapdoor, can hear the Joker pacing.

INT. BELFRY - THAT MOMENT

The Joker, hearing something beneath the trapdoor, begins
to move the second bell over it.  However, his curiosity
gets the better of him and he lifts the trap a fraction
of an inch.  He opens the trap fully, no Batman.

		JOKER
	I must have belled the bat!

Joker LAUGHS then stops and looks around slowly.

		JOKER
	There ain't any more of you up
	here, are there? -- Daddy or Momma
	bat?

The Joker LAUGHS, CRAZILY.

		BATMAN (O.S.)
	My parents are dead.  But you
	remember that, don't you, Jack?

Joker turns quickly to see Batman standing with cape un-
furled.  A rappeling line hangs from his belt and out
onto the parapet.  A small pulley on the belt.  The
Joker CACKLES.

		JOKER
	You climbed up the outside with
	a rope!
		(LAUGHTER)
	You little monkey!  God, look at
	you.  You're a mess.
		(laughs)
	They're gonna be real mad at the
	costume shop when they see what
	you did to their suit.

Batman steps toward him.  Joker steps back into the
half-dark.

		BATMAN
		(wicked smile)
	Yeah, and they asked me to bring
	your face back to the shop for
	some work.  Even if I have to tear
	it off.

		JOKER
	You maniac, it was you who dropped
	me in the tanks.  You made me.

		BATMAN
	I made you.  And you made me.

		JOKER
	What is this?  I say you made me
	and you have to say I made you?
	How childish can you get?  You're
	insane.

		BATMAN
		(the voice of doom)
	Are we going to kill each other,
	Jack?

		JOKER (O.S.)
		(slightly nervous)
	Jack?  Jack's out, I'm running his
	body while he's gone.

		BATMAN
	Well, when you see him -- tell him
	I'm gonna kick his ass!

Batman steps in Joker's direction.  From out of the dark-
ness Joker swings a huge BELL which SMASHES INTO BATMAN.
He is knocked over backwards out onto the parapet, he
nearly falls over the edge.

BATMAN'S POV OF GROUND ZERO - NIGHT

A frightening view thirty stories down toward death.

EXT. CATHEDRAL - NIGHT

Batman catches himself just before he topples over.

INT. BELFRY - NIGHT

Joker creeps around alone.  Not sure if Batman fell.  He
hides, flattened up against an archway inside the belfry.

SOUND OF CHOPPER in distance.  Joker hears it.

		JOKER
		(into his radio)
	Step on it.  I'll be on the roof.

SUDDENLY, Batman appears behind Joker's shoulder.  He
jerks an arm around Joker's neck, pinning him against
archway.

		BATMAN
	Have you danced with the devil in
	the pale moonlight?

Joker jumps off the ground.  He tries to get away.
Batman wraps his other arm around and, ""click,"" hand-
cuffs himself to the Joker.

		BATMAN
	Well, now's your big chance.

Joker struggles.  He twists and turns the handcuffs but
can't shift them.  He can hardly move.

		JOKER
		(pulling a Joker
		 flower from his coat)
	That was dumb.  Now I'm going to
	have to operate.

Joker SQUIRTS acid on the handcuffs.

Batman slips his arms back around Joker, pulling him into
the open.  They stand tethered face-to-face.  Joker hits
Batman hard, Batman returns the blow, Joker hits again,
and Batman returns.

The Joker gives a tremendous tug and the SIZZLING HAND-
CUFFS BREAK.  He runs to the wooden louvers.

Joker breaks a 2 by 4 from the wooden framework of belfry
and SMASHES Batman with it.

Batman goes down.  Joker hits him again.  HELICOPTER AP-
PROACHES and dangles ladder over parapet.  Joker STEPS
OUT onto parapet.  He grabs for the dangling ladder.

Batman looks up from where he has fallen.

HIS POV

UP INTO belfry where there are thousands of Bats stirring.

ON BATMAN

He activates a sonar device on his belt.  A SHRILL WHINE
lifts into the air.

						CUT TO:

EXT. BELLTOWER PARAPET - THAT MOMENT

Helicopter HOVERS at the side of the belltower.  Joker
steps up onto the wall between two GARGOYLES and puts
his foot onto one of the rungs of the ladder.  He looks
up as he hears UNEARTHLY SCREAMING FROM BELFRY.

EXT. BELLTOWER PARAPET - THAT MOMENT

Suddenly the AIR IS FULL OF BATS, diving and flapping
all over the place.  The NOISE from Batman's belt CLIMBS
IN PITCH.  As it does so the bats fly faster.  They swarm
above Joker in an ever thickening black cloud.

EXT. BELLTOWER PARAPET - MOMENTS LATER

The swarm of bats sweeps out and engulfs him.  He SCREAMS,
tries to beat them off.

ON BATS

Suddenly Batman steps through the cloud.

He grabs Joker.  Pulling him off the ladder.  Batman
lifts him bodily up off the ground by front of his coat.
He pushes him back against a Gargoyle.

Joker struggles and the Gargoyle crumbles and Joker
slips backward.  Joker knows he's a dead man, and he
smiles.  He grabs for Batman's cowl and grips it as he
falls.

		JOKER
	I saved the last dance for you.
Both of them tumble down into the endless darkness.

EXT. CATHEDRAL TOWER - NIGHT

Two bodies fall in pas de deux.  Joker SCREAMS.  SOUND OF
WIND RUSHING BY.

EXT. FALLING POV - NIGHT

CAMERA FALLS DOWNWARD.  Lights float lazily up AT us from
the onrushing street below.

EXT. FALLING - NIGHT - TIGHT

BATMAN FIRES a hook and a line back up at the roof.

ON HOOK

It lands on roof and skitters along looking for a crevice
to hook on.

ON JOKER

He stares back at Batman as he drifts away.  JOKER'S
LAUGHING ALL THE WAY DOWN.

ON HOOK

SKITTERING.

ON BATMAN

He spreads his cape, slowing down a bit.

ON GARGOYLE

Hook skitters to it and seizes on its grimacing jaws.

ON JOKER (SLOW MOTION)

He plummets to earth CRASHING ON CATHEDRAL STEPS.
LAUGHTER STOPS!

ON BATMAN (SLOW MOTION)

HE FALLS, TURNS UPSIDE-DOWN AND STOPS in mid-air.

Coming to the end of a long tether from the top of the
tower.  He bounces a bit and hangs upside-down.  Like a
bat.  A SCREAM fills the air.

EXT. CHURCH STEPS - OVERHEAD ANGLE

We're looking DOWN AT the Joker, whose body lies splayed
and broken on the steps.  We DRIFT DOWNWARD, CLOSER,
until his FACE FILLS THE SCREEN, his chilling grin still
intact.

The Joker's expression is almost childlike, as he stares
aimlessly at the stars.

A FLASHBULB POPS --

REVERSE ANGLE

to see Vicki Vale, taking the photo of the year.  She
looks down at him and shakes her head.  A SHOUT FROM
ELSEWHERE wakes her up.

		VOICE
	Batman's fallen to the ground.
	Over there.

Vicki spins around.  LOOKS in that direction and follows
the voice.

EXT. CATHEDRAL GROUNDS - NIGHT

People run toward the place where Batman has fallen.

CLOSER

We see the figure of Batman completely covered with his
cape, face-down in the courtyard.  A CIRCLE OF PEOPLE,
press, and police surround him.  Commissioner Gordon
steps into the circle.

		VOICE
	Turn him over, now we'll see who
	this guy is.

Gordon approaches the body.

Vicki RUSHES UP.  Looks down at the cape-covered body.
Looking at her camera, conflicted, she raises it to take
her prize photo.

ON CAPE

-- as Gordon pulls back cape and turns over the body.

TIGHT ON FACE

-- it's not Bruce Wayne, it's a groggy Alexander Knox
(in his own clothes).

ON VICKI

-- she flashes a picture and brings down her camera.  A
smile plays across her face.

ON KNOX

-- he blinks his eyes at the light.

		KNOX
	Can I still make the late edition?

EXT. ELSEWHERE IN THE SQUARE - NIGHT

Through a crowd, A MAN walks into a side street.  He
turns around.  It's Bruce Wayne.  He's got his utility
belt over his shoulder.  He DISAPPEARS into the darkness.

						DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. WAYNE MANOR - EVENING

It's majestic.  WIND RUSTLES through the trees.

		DENT (V.O.)
	All right members of the press,
	Commissioner Gordon and I have a
	few announcements to make.

						CUT TO:

EXT. PRESS CONFERENCE - NEXT EVENING

A large group of press gathers outside the courthouse to
hear Dent, Mayor and Gordon sum up the events.

		DENT
	First of all -- to clear up a
	little misunderstanding.  Gotham
	Globe reporter Alexander Knox
	is NOT Batman.

ALL HEADS turn to see blushing Knox.  He grins and
touches the bandage on his head.

		KNOX
	On the other hand, he's not
	Alexander Knox.

		GORDON
	Our police officers have recovered
	and although some of them have
	sworn off coffee, they're all back
	on duty.

Mare LAUGHTER -- Vicki steps up next to Allie.

		KNOX
	Aren't you covering this press
	conference Vicki?

		VICKI
	No, I'm gonna disappear a while.

Unexpectedly Vicki kisses Allie on the lips, long and
sweet.  He is stunned.

		VICKI
	It was a ride, wasn't it Allie?
	See you around.

		KNOX
	Wait a minute.  What about us?

Vicki is already down the street.

		KNOX
	What about the Pulitzer prize?

		VICKI
	You get mine for me Allie.

She WALKS AWAY.  Allie steps out into the street.
SHOUTS.

		KNOX
	Well what about your picture of
	Batman?

		VICKI
		(over her shoulder,
		 with irony)
	If he wants his picture taken,
	he knows where to find me.

ON DENT

--  he now has the stage.

		DENT
	We received a letter from Batman
	this morning.
		(reading)
	Gotham City's earned a rest from
	crime... But if the forces of evil
	should rise again, to cast a
	shadow on the heart of the city.
	Call me.

ON PRESS

-- they are quiet.

		KNOX
	Question.  How do we call him?

		GORDON
	He gave us a signal.

ON GORDON

-- he steps to a searchlight and flips it on.

EXT. GOTHAM CITY WIDE - NIGHT

On the side of the old cathedral, the BATSIGNAL - the
yellow moon, a black-caped man, the melancholy icon
calling for help in the dark night of Gotham City.

EXT. DARK STREET - NIGHT

FOOTSTEPS down the street.  As they get closer WE SEE
it's Vicki.  She passes by an old building.  SOMETHING
RUNS INTO her.  She looks down to see TWO LITTLE BOYS
dressed in homemade Batman costumes.

		LITTLE BOY
	Sorry lady, we was playin' Batman.

They TAKE OFF past her.  She looks after them smiling.

A SOUND somewhere in the darkness above.  She turns to
look.

EXT. TOP OF BUILDING - NIGHT

BACKLIT, Batman, silently looking down at her.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

She gazes up at him.  A limousine is suddenly next to
her.  She looks in.  It's Alfred.

		ALFRED
	I thought champagne might be in
	order, Ma'am.

Vicki smiles, GETS IN BACK.

INT. CAR - NIGHT

Vicki settles in.  Champagne and crystal set in back-
seat.  Alfred DRIVES OFF.

		ALFRED
	Mr. Wayne said to tell you he'd
	be a bit late.

		VICKI
	I'm not surprised Alfred.  I'm
	not surprised.

EXT. ABOVE THE STREET - NIGHT

Batman watches, dances across a rooftop.  BATSIGNAL IN
BACKGROUND.

						FADE OUT.

Right now, Diz is like, finally
Abu is spending time with me
Let's get to it, a battle or a fight?
What you people really trying to see?
Cause I don't give a fuck, either one of them is fine with me
I'm a G, it's too many hypocrites in this society
How many times y'all watched that Jones clip? Don't lie to me
It seems y'all got a fatal attraction for my variety
They tell me grow up, I'm Peter Pan, they get fly with me, I'm stealing
My hook's like piracy, but I agree
Battle rappers shouldn't act violently, it ain't a nice look
But this is hip hop, so you can blow up with the right hook, I'm back, y'all
Haters form a line on my sack, so you can say you stood with me when you heard I got blackballed
My chances with getting a match were slim as a scratch-off
But thanks to these wack, soft, amateur jack offs, and top-tier niggas that slacked off
Now my phone's ringing off the hook like Jones when he backed off, let's talk facts
Before your first match, I was that nigga, the click-clack cap peeler, that Brooklyn vernacular
I held you back in Canada, you wanted to scrap
Them white boys saw some Math in D like Mac Miller, you rap filler
Your flow's easy to track, if Eminem held a class on how Arabs could rap iller
I'll look at you and see a star pupil, you Jack Thriller
In that Total Slaughter match, yeah, I choked but came back killer
Looking at my phone - I ain't never do that, nigga
Thought I was watching 24 with your battle with Pat
Cause you choked, but to save the day, you ran to that Jack, nigga
You was on the stage, looking all suspenseful, coming off your temple
But you lost your tempo, what happened to that freestyle that we thought was special?
You looked in your phone to look at the rhymes Caustic texted you
Flashback, I catch Diz in a whip, I pull him out the Jag
Chop his calf with a machete until it drop in half
Flip him over like, is you ready? Then I pop the mag
Things a black man gotta do just to stop a cab
Remember that? I should've killed you sooner
But I knew you'd come back this road, I see the future
No, I'm lying, I needed Uber
You Jesus in L.A.? That's cool cause I reviewed the scripture
They booked the Matthew for Driveby, a crew should fix ya
If you don't throw a strike, then Organik 'bout to lose a picture
I came on stage with a tool to stick ya
I said, if you don't throw a strike, your organs is going to lose a pitcher
Stupid, I'm talking about your fluids, nigga
Who you fooling? I was chewing you in Brooklyn, you just some leftovers
Escaped the belly of the beast, guess you the next Jonah
This where Dizaster reign? It's time he met Noah
You delusional, this your funeral, you a meth smoker
Get sober, they gon' say that nigga Math left BOLA
With the head of the heads bolas dead soldier over his left shoulder
You don't got bars like that
I know y'all like, why he doing Akbar like that?
So try not to fall asleep, you know his bars type wack
[Round 1: Dizaster]

You ready?
I said, you better not do something stupid
Cause they gon' lose you out in Cali, Math
After this, we gon' have a shooting battle from the Cadillac
You didn't hear me, I said if you do something stupid, we gon' start shooting in the middle of the battle like Cadalack
Now we out the west, he coastin'
It's Math Hoffa, accepts two battles in one week's span so the other one gets less promotion
It's true, in a week he's going to step to O-Red
He has a death wish, let him go then
If he survives here, in a week, he'd be leaking everywhere just like Edward Snowden
Last time we battled, you choked, d-d-duh-duh-did I hear Math stutter?
Long blade like this hands smothered with all types of saw buzzers and slab cutters
Catch a butterfly to your mouth like the bitch from the Silence of the Lambs cover, damn, brother
This is the last saga of Math Hoffa
Hat's off, he's a slap boxer, why you mad?
Punchlines never land proper so he'll put hands on ya
For the sake of shock value, he's a black Blanka
He said if we piss him off, he gon' let the gat ""blaka""
HA, HAHA
One false move, we gon' feed you all types of shells from clam pasta
To crab lobster to trash off of a can if you keep acting like a trash talker
You gon' get the large can till they start calling Math Oscar
You get your ass shot, operation Black Water, watch Math drop so fast
He hit the floor flat on your back like an ab rocker
That Glock in my hand cocked, you will see clips from the smith flying like Hancock
Damn, Hoffa
It's Hoffa doggie, here to fuck up another classic with one of his sucker tactics
But today is like a court date, we all get to judge who Math is
He went a whole round with Jones, and no one reacted
Till he finally swung on him and that was his first punch that landed
Yo, go get a punching bag next time you wanna practice
Instead of feeding your brother a knuckle sandwich and shutting down Summer Madness
Your words don't connect, so you swing to get your punches across
That's how much of a buster Math is
Yeah, that's why you never get no respect
That's why you never get no respect
What happened? Why you want to punk dudes like little Mookie and T-Rex?
What happened last time you came to L.A.? Where was your reflex?
When you got water poured all over your shoes and you got G checked
I guess you could say it was his first time in L.A. and he was still getting his feet wet
You socked so many skinny motherfuckers that didn't drop, I'm somewhat amazed
Just off of that, I could call you a pussy in hundreds of ways
But I'd rather sum it up in one phrase
Your battle with Daylyt's the only time you've ever slept someone on stage, shit
If he's an N.Y. thug, I'm a Star Wars militia trooper
If he got his pistol, I'm set tripping in the missile cruiser
But I got the pistol, too, I'm a skillful user
Click-click, you end up missing from the clip, like the hidden blooper
Ain't shit that you could do to convince me that this kid's a shooter
I'll have the homie catch him in his Mini Cooper with the 50 Ruger
Leave his brains hanging like Mr. Cooper, then blame it on a Crip from Hoover
On everything, but fuck all the violence
You supposed to be a good influence on kids, like a physics tutor
But ever since your name didn't end up holding as much weight, you became the biggest loser
If only you could take a time machine back to before you punched Dose
So you could see that in the distant future
You'd end up killing yourself like Bruce Willis did to the kid from Looper
Yeah, look what fucking battling did to you
Now every single camera interview, they harass and they question you
How are you a real man when you let rap lyrics get to you?
You said you believe in god?
Least you could do is respect the talent he's given you
And be proud with the powers you're gifted with cause there's thousands of kids that would die to be able to experience half of the shit we do, but you
You're just a piece of shit I met countless amounts like men like you
Take everything for granted till the universe decides to snap and get rid of you
The laws of attraction is principle, but you never had a dad that disciplined you
And tell you that as a kid, all you had was your inner you and that's what you listen to
But look what that shit done did to you
Now you smack every single dude that gets within half of an inch of you
Cause you have to disguise that trapped little bitch in you
In some type of Anderson Silva move
[Round 2: Math Hoffa]

This is battle rap, two emcees hit the stage
With no beat, they compete with rap schemes and displays
Now some bitch-ass niggas like to fake beef to get paid
But at the end of the day, he ain't mean, he just gay
And he don't mean what he say
Like when you said you retired, I guess you didn't mean that, fool
You said I was scared to come to L.A., I guess you didn't mean that, too
You said if we scrapped, then that's gon' make your team scrap, too
Well, tell me who gon' block the shot after I cream Abdul?
You a bitch, it ain't enough your battle see mad views
They respect you, but you want to be a street cat, too
Well, I was tailored in the streets, just cause I seem mad cool
You press me, you on your ass like your jeans tag Trus, dreamland, snooze
Wake up with your cheek mad bruised
Teeth cracked, getting the recap, it's that Summer Madness 3 bad news
Where your team at? You niggas want to react? Oooo, you lucky K.O.T.D. made sure we had food
Batty man, I'm 'bout to murder the Taliban
Banana clips, somebody call in the Tally man
I was eating, Diz wanted piece like the Dalai Lam'
You slip and drop that chicken Parmesan, boy, it's Ramadan
If I was hungry, I'd beat up anybody hanging with D
Especially Okwerdz, I get the feeling when he hangin' with me
That he's so racist, his favorite movie is Hangover 3
Ok', you come out of retirement I'ma put you on bed rest
Send techs in his mouth, boom, all you see is a red neck
I'm from the Apple, y'all try to give me the beats
I'll make your fucking doctor rich with no headset
Surprised you ain't dead yet
You be taking all them methamphetamines
DO me a favor, never get blasted off of heroin
Cause that'll get you outclassed and out of your element
Cause on Smack, you was the wackest that you ever been
You battled Rex, round for round, you got pound to death
Cortez put you in a box, spitting out your best
Ars, you was out of step, Aye Verb counted, yes
Now you gon' catch a bullet to your temple like Malcolm X
This gon' be a view of what a Jew would do with Hitler
I'm using Hitler cause your man think that you's a nigga
You speak in person, you be using nigga
I guess you Donald Sterling and your Krack City crew's the Clippers
I mean, why you hang with them? They bang you out in the Crip house?
This asshole is like his asshole, it got a big mouth
I bet when y’all be sparring and Dizaster start to wig out
After 40 bars, Daylyt pull his dick out
Straight disrespect, that’s how you wanted it, brother
I take it a step farther and cum in your mother
It don’t matter if I’m home, if I come with the hunger
I’m whipping dog on the road like Dumb and Dumber
Cause you don’t got bars like that
Why your uncles be slipper-skating next to cars like that?
So try not to fall asleep, you know his bars type wack
And I’ll be here next round to bring the bars right back
[Round 2: Dizaster]

You try to rap to me Jamaican like you got a Rastafari Alliance
But you a fake Jamaican, like Snoop, dog, you lyin'
Speaking of dogs, I’ma give it to his bitch, Bonnie, raw dog
Next time he calls me Abu, I’m going to invite her over for a motherfucking hot dog
Listen, pay attention, it’s like hunting season ever since they run from me
I’m like the first shooting game for Nintendo, I was on everybody’s screen
I aimed at everything that was ever considered fly above from me
And even though they dogged me in the end, this whole scene started with everybody ducking me
There’s level to this, meet the game designer
You said you've been through a lot of shit, well, you have a lot of kids
So that’s probably baby diapers
You think I’m scared of you? I’m from Lebanon, we raise survivors
Train Al-Qaeda snipers, you do drive-bys?
We do car bombs like my block's sponsored by Jagermeister, what?
I can’t believe they pay you for being such a basic rhymer
Safe to say you're 35, you haven’t blown up
So you'll never be a fucking famous major label writer
You gon' be stuck in the underground for a long time, like a Chilean miner
If they put you in a cage, you’d be an amazing fighter
He’s a big-ass giant cyclops that hits people from the blind spot like an Asian driver
I’m 'bout to get rid of this mathematician with a thousand different algorithms
Made up of the foul decisions in life that cloud his vision
But what'd knocking them out prove? That if your rounds ain’t hittin'
You’ll swing in the middle of the round and hit 'em
And show up without a second round like you did out in England
And maybe you allowed to, but not in our division
Out there they might be proud of you, but I swear to god
You show up without a round two, Math, we’re going to beat the living algebra out of you
And I ain’t even power tripping, cause rather what I would do is
Out-rhyme you and algebraically out-style you
Triangulate on all of your ground moves
See, the root of the problem is there’s nothing positive about you
So I focus on the negatives and try to subtract them out of you
Minus all of your foul moves and that’s how you
Calculate Matthew’s absolute value, yeah
We seen you against Calicoe in New York
We seen the whole crowd give up
You got booed trying to make your style adjust
Your man Cortez battled with Cal, got slumped
I seen Hanz try to get in Calicoe’s face and his ass got punked
If you take the three of y’all together and you add them up
It means half of your squad went against a Cal, got crushed
Which proves we'll always be better at Math
Cause we would never let a Cal kill us
But I know who Hoffa, Math is, got everything dog-shit backwards
His bars don’t cause no impact so he starts socking rappers
Cause if he had fire, he would go lighter
And wouldn’t have to strike 'em on the side like boxing matches
Pay attention, if he had fire, lighter, box of matches
Yeah, now I sound like all you faggots, hah
He’s a fucking nice guy, he’s not even bad, that’s what he wants you to misinterpret
He’s like Richard Sherman, he only switches when he gets behind the filming curtain
He smiles in your face, then gets on a track and quickly turns into Math, the killing version
He’s like Dexter, cause every time he gets in the lab, he becomes a different person, yeah
But I’ma tell you now Math, be cool, 'cous
I’m serious, Math be cool, Blood
You said you gon' smack me, you said Math gon' do what?
I seen you the first time, we was chilling with Triune once
You stood up in the corner like you was gon' do something
Soon as you seen him, you was like, my dude, what's up?
Fucking fruit cup
I’m trying to show you the large picture
No, like serious, Math, I’m trying to show you a large picture
No, like pay attention, I’m trying to show you a large picture!

[Round 3: Math Hoffa]

This nigga blew up a picture of me with no shirt on
That's some other shit
But I bet off of the strength of that picture, tonight, I'ma fuck a bitch
But you, you dropped Islam just so you could suck a dick
Cause ain't no repercussion for faggots up on the mothership
Now let's get real
When Pac died, the whole west side fell in depression
When B.I.G. died, the whole east side was mentally stressin'
See Pac wrote songs that led the black man to progression
B.I.G. said, “Sky's The Limit” before his death and ascension
But this is why they fear battle rap, cause of how we vent our aggression
If that aggression is genuine, this shit could end in a second
I still remember the question, is there a ghetto in heaven?
I don’t know, but after tonight, there should be a 7/11
I enter the session, calm just to censor the tension
For them stacks, I kick that shit, I’m Benjamin Beckham
You do a lot of dumb shit just to get some attention
It’s like if people think he hard, this nigga gets an erection
You a Arab-American bragging 'bout a weapons collection
I’m surprised the FBI hasn’t sent an inspection
But since you talking guns, them shots gon' be denting your chest in
Arabs love oil, he getting drenched with the Wesson
See, I came into this battle with the plans of a mover
You disappear from where you stand in the future
Reappear in the past next to a corn field and hammers’ll shoot ya
That’s how you see an end, faggot, Anderson Cooper
This suicide, Diz you know you gon' die tonight
I’m like a steering wheel in London, I be riding right
But this was probably part of your plan, an Al-Qaeda strike
What happens when a Arab’s rapping with black dynamite?
I rack, putting bodies in Glad bags
I can’t even tell my pops what I do, I might get bagged, dad
I heard Daylyt really box, and he ain’t half bad
But Math jab faster than a Dot Mob ass-grab
You been taking Daylyt’s style, give it back, fag
Trying to stay ahead of the trend? Guess you a hash-tag
You lost on the show and broke out, you was mad sad
Ain’t even say bye to your homie, that’s a back-stab
I guess your ass really needed the guap
Cause you ain’t pay back Marvwon for the meals that he copped
Cortez for the weed when you needed some pot
You ain’t even pay back Big T when you needed some socks
You bum-ass nigga, you gave me writer's block, the worst of this year
I watched your battles till your fucking voice was hurting my ears
I put the pen to the page, hoping verses appear
But this is why I hate Scrabble, sometimes I got no words for these squares
I mean, shit be all set, I got my target in sight
But the shit I’m wanting to write ain’t part of plight
Cause everybody spits the same and y’all reward 'em for bites
I’d rather narrate the Wonder Years and talk through your life
See, niggas know I spit hard, but they be caught in the hype
Vers’ Math, you get the draft, either a bar or a fight
So Diz gon' stand on the stage and try to offer advice
But I’m ten steps ahead like when you walk with your wife
I mean, Diz, let’s keep it real, how bad could I be?
You took the bargaining price, they paid me top dollar
You even paid for part of my flight
Last time we spoke, you was broke walking dog in your night
So when the fame’s gone, D, you gon' be starving for life
You got a broke nigga swag, your face says, “I browse”
All these fans and you can’t even count five thou’ right now
As far as I’m concerned, all of us should be iced out
But let’s talk about how you cried out in that Bed Stuy house
You told a room full of battle rappers that you wanted to kill yourself
Cause you 30 plus and broke and can’t find a way to build your wealth
You had the same sweats on for three days, to keep it real or help
I slept in my jeans just in case he tried to steal a belt
Wake up in the morning smelling curry chicken
Diz hanging in the basement like a dummy twitchin’
Feeling fucked with no love, that’s the buddy system
I told Muhammad treat life like it’s Sonny Liston
One of your mans got cancer, and he fighting for life
But you'd rather take yours cause you light with your price
If I was him, I’d slap your ass twice with a right
When we die, we die as men, you gon' die as a dyke
All you are is an emotional bitch
All you wanted was attention when you told us you quit
All you wanted was attention when you told us that shit
Your parents raised the blade, you should go for your wrist
And when you die as a atheist, and your ghost in the midst
And god ask, “Yo, Bachir, who told you to quit?
I gave you so many gifts, now I gotta kick his soul to the pit""
Spoiled brat, couldn’t adjust after growing up rich
Real shit, they’ll never take that from me
That’s why a nigga still smile when it ain’t that sunny
He was crying cause he broke, ain’t that funny?
Well, I give him a couple bucks, that’s that Arab money
You fuck rapper, I split you and spill your guts after
Look, Ockie, you sloppier than a nut catcher
This how Brooklyn do, every time I look at you
(I wanna put a fist, knife, bullet, or a foot in you)
No, I wanna say, “give me two loosies and a Dutchmaster!”
Hoffa

[Round 3: Dizaster]

Yo, how the fuck do you cheer for the type of shit this dude writes?
Like serious, no punchline
This dude called me rich and broke in the same fucking round
You’re the dumbest dude I’ve ever met in my life
Math, Math Hoffa, the fuck is wrong with you
With all these stupid Apu lines
And the fucking lines about Arab women?
Okay, you wanna fucking lie, you fucking racist?
I’ma hit you with a racist line that’ll leave your mind spinnin'
I will make an agreement with you, I’ll agree to cover up all my women
If you can agree to cut down on all the fried chicken
And for once in your life actually try swimming
Let me tell you some shit that y’all didn’t know
About Bonnie and Drake, when he was about to take her out on a date
Don’t roll your eyes cause you got mad at Bonnie and you started to hate
Yo, Drake was about to put Bonnie up in a fucking suite like a little ho
Why you think World Domination was booked
And we got ourselves a little dough?
And the reason why she never met with him is cause
He started to act like a little ho, and that’s why she didn’t go
And he getting mad cause I’m like Einstein
I’m exposing shit about Math that you didn’t know
You trip, I let the clip explode, you wanna act like a fricking ho
I predict the shit that you gonna say like Charlie Clips when he did the Piccolo
You try to throw a jab, I sidestep it and crack Math like the DaVinci Code
Stop looking at the fucking phone, you starting to distract me
You could play if you want to
But don’t think that I ain’t afraid to have one of the homies pull a trey eight and pop you
Bro, don’t think I’m afraid to sock you
I’m like Edward Scissorhands, I was born with the metal in my hands
But you could still catch the fade if you want to
Fuck your little fucking metaphor, little four-bar, little schemes
I came to destroy y’all regime, I catch a body like nobody has seen
And show up to your funeral and stand above your casket
And dump metal in your box like a Coinstar machine, yeah
And you just mad and all scared
Because he thinks I’m come in here touching you
Now we see you last time out here, dog
You were clearly way uncomfortable
Thought it was all Love & Hip Hop till Daylyt got on him
Did you see the way he busted you?
From far away, that shit look like Stevie J was punking you
I’m a war syndicate, I’ll torture your ass
You throw a punch and put more force into it than a Morpheus jab
There’s not a home item I won’t hit you with
I’ll snatch the plates, forks and I’ll stab you with it
Till your face warps like the Old Testament
Step on mine and you’ll get bone and a frag
Once the force of the blast will leave you with torn ligaments
Shoulders collapse, bones missing, organs attached to the floor
Like your cord's been slashed with a rotary axis from close distance
I’m so vicious, I’ll show up to your pad like Jehovah’s Witness
And force entry into your door entrance
And sulfuric acid your bone remnants till there’s no more evidence
For forensics to report to the lab
You go from shows with sold tickets to more victims
To forgiveness from the mortician to the morgue in the bag
From short visits from close friendships to identify your toe with a tag
But what good is a mortician when all of your toes missing, body cold as a slab?
His corpse shows symptoms of rigor mortis and cold stiffness
Like co-defendants in court before the witness
Let me show you the math
This is the type of hole you diggin'
I told him if he shows up trippin', I’ll be forced to hit him
Grab him by his throat and kick him
Take him to the floor and quickly force submission
Push his torso in grab his arm and Kimora twist him
Into a choke-hold position like Forrest Griffin, yeah
I’ll fucking center in a fire round the home you live in
And throw your son in the middle of it like the solar system
I’ll expose these cats and leave 'em leaving here out the door straight limpin'
I’m down to rustle in the house like Kimora Simmons, yeah
Just keep pretending it’s just jealousy and envy
It’s that next breed, they surpass him he’s a Cessna engine and they surpassed him like jet speed
He knows if he don’t do something they gon' forget him like PS3
So he needed something trendy, why you think he shut down SM3?
Everybody from the event flee and Smack lost money on spent fees
But you brought this on your own selfie
I mean, you brought this on your own self, G
You wanted to have all the muscle in the hood
You couldn’t be a normal mustang, you just wanted to be a Shelby
Cause you're selfish, fuck battling, you should enter UFC
You ain’t a real man, a real man respects his enemies
A real man uses his verbal skills and only reacts with his hands as a necessity
Cause any man can throw a jab effectively
But it takes a bigger man to know you the bigger man and to just let it be
That’s why you lost all respect from me
You could be the knockout MVP, but you’ll never be the best emcee
You went your whole life trying to be the one
But you just killing yourself over and over like Jet Li
He ain’t no motherfucking battling legend
He only has one classic battle with Serius and that ain’t no classic
He had to stab Smack in the back just to get it
You’re wack and pathetic, fuck the fans that respect it
You don’t have any ethics, you dissed Cali now you back out west
Begging the same people you dissed in the past for acceptance
Cause you’re a passive-aggressive, sensitive-ass, feminine faggot
Suffering from manic depression who’s mad
No one in battle rap wants to give his ass no attention
Even his own family rejects him, fuck, Smack don’t respect him
He only here cause he got canned, before that, we never seen his ass on the premises
So this is all I need to back up all the tracks into evidence
The only reason you’re here cause over there you don’t have any relevance
You fucking waste of life, I should punch you in your fucking face right now","[('I’m whipping dog on the road like Dumb and Dumber', [['The 1994 movie, “Dumb and Dumber” revolves around brothers who are on a journey to return a briefcase full of money.
