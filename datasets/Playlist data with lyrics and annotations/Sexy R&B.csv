This line implies that the speaker’s desire for sex is as powerful as an addict’s need for drugs.  Walker delves into this theme even more deeply in “Wasted”, which contemplates the allure of an intoxicating yet unhealthy relationship.\n\nComparing romantic longings with those of drug users is a classic trope in popular music, going back to songs like 1973’s “Love Jones” or even 1932’s “You’re Getting to Be a Habit With Me.”  Considering that love actually does cause the production of mind-altering chemicals, this is perhaps unsurprising.']])]",0.9928,0.9928,0.1489,Aroused

I wanna give you better
Baby, it's whatever
Somebody gotta step up
Girl, I'm that somebody, so I'm next up
Be damned if I let him catch up
It's easy to see that you're fed up
I am on a whole 'nother level
Girl, he only fucked you over 'cause you let him
Fuck him, girl, I guess he didn't know any better
Girl, that man didn't show any effort
Do all I can just to show you you're special
Certain it's your love that holds me together
Lately you say he been killin' the vibe
Gotta be sick of this guy
Pull up, skrr, get in the ride
Left hand is steerin' the other is grippin' your thigh
Light up a spliff and get high
Shawty, you deserve what you've been missin'
Lookin' at you I'm thinkin' he must be trippin'
Play this song for him, tell him, ""Just listen""
[Chorus]
Don't
Don't

[Verse 2]
Girl, said he keeps on playin' games
And his lovin' ain't the same
I don't know what to say, but
What a shame
If you were mine you would not get the same
If you were mine you would top everything
Suicide in the drop switchin' lanes
And that thing so fire, baby, no propane
Got good pussy, girl, can I be frank?
To keep it 100, girl, I ain't no saint
But he the only reason that I'm feelin' this way
Givin' you the world, baby, when you get space
Pen game get me laid, baby, that's penetrate
Oh baby

[Chorus]
Don't

H-Town got a nigga so throwed
Pour up, we can party some more
Yeah, got this drank in my cup
Got a young nigga feelin' so throwed
Spit fire in a world so cold

I can’t finish my song, my song is kinda short so let’s combine ‘em.”']]), ('[Verse 1]', [['On this song, I’m not boyfriend number two and I’m not trapped in the friend zone. I’m actually pretending; I jumped out of myself and got into a perspective of somebody else.\n\nI wasn’t doing what I needed to be doing in my relationship at that time and I was kinda fucking up, so I thought what if somebody else stepped in the picture? So, I said cool I’m gonna be that person and write a song from his perspective, trying to get my girl. That’s something that nobody would know ever.\n\nThe song is actually longer. I had a longer verse, I started just talking shit after that and I just went off. I’m glad that it was shorter because all the other stuff that I said didn’t really make sense at all. It was still dope, but the reason I couldn’t finish the song was because my computer was messed up and every time I tried to finish it, it would be real static-y.']]), ('Givin’ you the world, baby, when you get space', [['Note the correlation between “space” and “world.”\n\nWhenever the man lets her go and she’s free from his “hold,” Bryson is prepared to swoop in and save the day. He’s patiently waiting for that magical day when he can finally prove to the girl what kind of man he is.']]), ('Got good pussy, girl, can I be frank?\n To keep it 100, girl, I ain’t no saint\n But he the only reason that I’m feelin’ this way', [['“Being frank” is equivalent to being blunt, but also funtions as a subtle reference to Benjamin Franklin, the face on the $100 dollar bill (“keep it 100”).\n\nThis is the point where Bryson’s starting to get sick of playing games, and cuts to the chase. The man’s not worthy of her true value, and Bryson’s mighty jealous that she’s not his companion. He really, really wants her “good pussy.”']]), ('Suicide in the drop switchin’ lanes\n And that thing so fire, baby, no propane', [['“Suicide doors” are doors that are hinged at the rear edge rather than in the front like your regular doors. It got its name because if the doors were to open during movement, one could easily fall out when trying to grab the door handle (these type of doors were popular before the age of seat-belts). Rappers often mistake them for “scissor doors.”\n\nNot only is propane commonly used as vehicle fuel, it is also highly flammable. Bryson plays with the slang meaning of “fire” to describe how extravagant his choice of car truly is. How can girls resist the temptation?\n\n“Fire” could also be in reference to how good the sex is with the subject of the song as he follows up with, “Got good pussy, girl can I be frank”.']]), ('Pen game get me laid, baby, that’s penetrate\n Oh baby', [['Bryson puts the “pen” in “penetrate,” baby – his writing and ability to make music is so grand it can get him with any girl he should so desire to be with. “Pen Griffey” is also one of his nicknames.']]), ('Spit fire in a world so cold\n Young money got a nigga feelin’ old\n Spit fire in a world so cold', [['Bryson is making major checks at a young age—his numbers are up there with veterans of the game.

Therefore, it’s time to get with Bryson.\n\n“Skurt”  onomatopoetically suggests the screeching sound that tires make when coming to a fast halt, but it also refers to the girl’s skirt, which he pulls up to grip her thigh while driving.']]), ('H-Town got a nigga so throwed\n Pour up, we can party some more\n Yeah, got this drank in my cup\n Got a young nigga feelin’ so throwed', [['“Throwed” is Houston slang for being wasted, high, or even both; which is appropriate for the city home to the rappers who popularized rapping about that purple drank.']])]",-0.9653,-0.9653,0.1987,Aroused

Like I said, this song can be interpreted so many different ways, so the way I wrote it was obviously from a sense of, this is not necessarily a bad situation. It’s almost too good, so I’m trying to make it bad to protect myself, if that makes sense. I think a lot of us do that in a lot of cases, but it could mean anything. Trippin', it could mean anything. But for me, it’s basically when you feel like it’s too good to be true and you’re tryna make sure that you don’t get hurt, because I’m very protective.""]]), ('But I tripped on your love, now I’m addicted', [['I definitely feel like love can feel like a drug sometimes. Sometimes you feel like if you’re not getting back the same love that you’re putting in, you’re withdrawn, almost, and you just feel like you need it, and sometimes you can’t put your finger on what exactly it is about it or about the person that makes you love them so much. Sometimes you can’t understand, and I think that’s why sometimes people stay in bad relationships and that’s why good relationships last so long. It can be both sides of the spectrum, really.']]), ('Maybe it’s your love, it’s too good to be true\n Baby boy, your love, got me trippin’ on you', [['I definitely have been a situation where I felt like this might be too good to be true and you kind of take a backseat, and it’s like, “Maybe I should chill out.” But then, again, again, in the sense of what the song is, I come to find out that I was just making myself believe that, because at the end of the day, sometimes, it’s not too good to be true.

So the chorus, is a moment of realization of being like, “Wait. I have to give everyone an even playing field,” and be like, “This is actually me.

It’s actually worse. When you get married, you say, “For better or for worse,” right? In wedding vows, right? So “That’s just too bitter for worse, don’t wanna taste it,” is as in, imagine if you’re getting married to someone and they say, “For better or for worse,” but we’re using “better” as “bitter,” because this is a bitter situation.

I think if you think about running a marathon, you’ve put all of this training in, you’ve put all of this working out, eating well, like, preparing yourself for this marathon, and you get to the marathon and you do 9K of that 10K, and then you just collapse or something gets in your way and you no longer can do the extra 1K, or the last 1K that you’re supposed to do, and it’s like all of that effort, all of that preparation that you’ve put in to not make it to where your end goal was, that’s frustrating.

When Selena came on Instagram live to greet her fans, someone asked the singer where Abel (The Weeknd) was during the celebrations, and she revealed that he was actually on his way home to her.\n\nFan: Where is Abel (The Weeknd)?\nSelena Gomez: “Abel’s on his way home”\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVUB4NjU9ms\n\nThe Weeknd also shared a similar sentiment on his Instagram stories in which his song, “I Feel It Coming” can be heard and the caption reads, “on my way to you 👑.” He had been in Paris performing and got a flight back immediately to Los Angeles for her.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/laceykennedy/status/888896011627884544']]), ('Girl, why can’t you wait? (Why can’t you wait, baby?)\n Girl, why can’t you wait ’til I fall out of love?', [['Abel could be referring to his breakup with Selena Gomez: shortly after they broke up, she started dating her ex, Justin Bieber; not giving Abel enough time to get over the relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, Abel was spotted leaving Bella Hadid’s apartment–who he dated previous to Gomez–shortly after, indicating that maybe he didn’t need much time after all.\n\nThese lines also call back to Thursday, where he sings on “The Birds (Part 2)”:\n\nShe said please, mercy me, mercy me\nLet me fall outta love, before you fuck her\n\n“The Birds (Part 2)” was released roughly 6 years before this song. Back then, the Weeknd would  describe himself as somewhat emotionless and would disregard the slightest chances of having a serious relationship. He’d hint that women would be foolish to fall in love with him due to these personality traits. When used in comparison with the current track, a significant change in Abel’s life and his ways is depicted.\n\nThe tables have definitely turned since his Thursday mixtape, in the most ironic of ways. He now finds himself in love with someone, begging her not to leave. He asks her to stay a little longer in order to ease the pain of her future departure, much as the woman on The Birds (Part 2) asked him years ago.\n\nAs painful as this may be for him, it does portray his emotional growth in relation to woman. He allowed himself to care for someone enough to get hurt.']]), ('Guess I was just another pit stop\n ’Til you made up your mind\n You just wasted my time', [['A pit stop refers to the pit where a racecar driver stops in the middle of a race to refuel and/or service the vehicle.\n\n\n\nThe Weeknd uses a pit stop as a metaphor to suggest that a girl whom he “put on top” had just used him for her own needs, almost in the same vein that a car refuels at a pit stop. He states that she had not actually been in love with him in the same way he had felt towards her.\n\nThis is most likely a reference to his relationship with fellow singer Selena Gomez. Selena and Abel broke up on October 30, 2017, after 10 months of dating; the very next day photos emerged of Selena reuniting with her former boyfriend Justin Bieber (whom she split in 2015). Hence, Abel would have been Selena’s metaphorical pit stop.']]), ('I said I didn’t feel nothing, baby, but I lied', [['Abel is notorious for his sexual escapades. He has not only spoken about his sexual prowess but also how detached he is in sexual situations and relationships. This physical-emotional detachment has been a constant theme in his music since his first mixtape, House of Balloons, and essentially facilitated the underlying plot of his second mixtape Thursday. This is almost as consistent and ever-present as allusions to his myriad drug-fueled adventures.\n\nHowever in “Adaptation” he demonstrates a self-awareness and desire for a meaningful feeling involved relationship:\n\nThen I realized\nShe might have been the one\nI let it go\nFor a little fun\n\nSo while he likely warned her that he was trouble along the lines of his famous line from “The Zone”:\n\nI can’t feel a damn thing\n\nAt his core, Abel does have a capacity to love. So despite saying he didn’t harbor any real feelings towards her, as he admits, he lied.\n\nThis isn’t the first time Abel has boasted about lying either, on “Montreal” he boasts how it comes natural to him,\n\nCuz ain’t nobody feels the way that I feel when I’m alone\nSo if I said that I won’t call\nThe lying comes natural to me']]), ('We found each other\n I helped you out of a broken place\n You gave me comfort\n But falling for you was my mistake', [['Abel is likely referring to his ex-girlfriend, Selena Gomez, whom he dated from January to October 2017.

I brought the fire, I might let you roll it up
Might let you act like you're in control
But we really know what's up, ayy
We really know, we don't got to front, no
Nobody knows, you know it stay between us
My little secret, my little only hit me on the weekend
When she don't got no plans, she don't got no man
She don't want no man
She just wants some love (she just wants some love)
Someone she can trust

Don't think too much
You should just leave your trust issues in Atlanta
NYC I just flew you up
And as you walk through that door you knew
I'm obviously a real one
So you should let your guard down tonight
I don't know you like that, but I wish
I would never ever call you my bitch
I would only call you wife, I would only do you right
I would talk literature, I would talk Deepak
I would pump you up like Reebok
He's not me don't compare us

This one goes out to all sides worldwide
Let that playa-ass nigga Thumpy be your guide
As we go on a ride
Where playa-hatin' killers and hood niggas thrive
And lame muh'fuckers can barely survive

[Verse 1: Jeremih]
Catch me rollin' through the city
Ridin' with the top off
Man, my whip so big, when you in it
Fuck around and get lost
Told my bitch to let her hair down
What this shit cost?
Tell me, baby, if you 'bout that life right now
Hope it ain't talk, no

I could put you in the Mile High Club
What's up? Let's take a trip
Have you ever read ""The World Is Yours""
On a blimp?

[Pre-Chorus: Jeremih]
Tell her be free, baby, spread your wings
Got your legs in the sky like a plane
Let me guide that, I'm the pilot
Can't nobody see you, 30,000 feet
On your knees in them Pradas
Makin' freaky shit come up out her
[Chorus: Jeremih]
Get high, baby, roll one
Cloud nine 'bout to go up
Lovin' the feelin' the turbulence get when we turn up
When we land, we can roll out
Show you somethin' you ain't know 'bout
Tonight, we be takin' off flight with a camera to show out

[Bridge: Jeremih]
I got you in the air, your body in the air
How it feel up here?
You can scream as loud as you want, loud as you can
And ain't nobody gonna hear

Would you like it better
If I hit the West Coast?
Tell me baby if you 'bout that life right now

You need a nigga when he done probably gon' put you out

And so far, my new shit's so fire, nigga, check my profile
Who you know make waves in the low tide?
Deebo'd yo bitch, now she both ours
Nigga, little brown liquor in my liver
Pretty brown thing in my bed
Been a long time since I had to ask for head
So goddamn, don't make me beg

On a blimp?","[('Can’t nobody see you, 30,000 feet\n On your knees in them Pradas\n Makin’ freaky shit come up out her', [['Jeremih often promises secrecy to make his sexual partners more comfortable. On “Don’t Tell Em”, he gets a private show by\xa0promising to keep the exchange to himself, and here he gets a blow job by emphasizing the privacy of a private jet – a much more secluded setting than his ride he described earlier.\n\nThese lyrics are reminiscent of Kanye West’s 2007 hit “Good Life,” in which he asks:\n\nHave you ever popped champagne on a plane,\nWhile gettin some brain\nWhipped it out, she said “I never seen Snakes on a Plane”']]), ('Told my bitch to let her hair down\n What this shit cost?\n Tell me, baby, if you ’bout that life right now\n Hope it ain’t talk, no', [['“Let your hair down” is a common phrase suggesting that one should relax a bit. When riding with the top down in a car, the wind messes up your hair. Jeremih’s lady friend seems to take this request literally, leading Jeremih to ask her how much her hair cost, as it will likely get messed up if she lets it down.\n\nWhile it may seem rude to ask about such a thing, it’s very common for women to wear some kind of hair extension. The wig and hair piece industry made\xa0$299 million in 2014, and it is expected to grow in the future.\n\n\n\nHer hair extensions make Jeremih worried that his girl might not be as laid back as he’d like her to be. She may just be saying she’s a go-with-the-flow type of person, but is, in reality, more high-maintenance.\n\nThe phrase “‘bout that life” has become a phenomenon in recent years. Often, people say that they’re about that life—that they’re cool, with-it, and down for whatever—but are really not.']]), ('I got you in the air, your body in the air\n How it feel up here?\n You can scream as loud as you want, loud as you can\n And ain’t nobody gonna hear', [['Jeremih’s Mile High Club adventures are intensified by his girl’s screams of pleasure. Though he’s trying to be romantic, his assurance that no one can hear her scream gives off more of a creepy horror movie vibe—any line that paraphrases Eminem’s “Kim” is bound to be a little short on romance.']]), ('Tell her be free, baby, spread your wings\n Got your legs in the sky like a plane\n Let me guide that, I’m the pilot', [['Jeremih does a good job of keeping the meaning of “spread your wings” ambiguous: at first it seems he is telling her to spread her metaphorical wings and become a free spirit, but his request that she lets him “guide that” suggests she’s simply spreading her legs and assuming the spread eagle sex position.']]), ('Would you like it better\n If I hit the West Coast?\n Tell me baby if you ’bout that life right now\n I hope it ain’t talk', [['Like Dr. Dre said, the West Coast is known for the women, weed, and weather. Jeremih’s recipe with the ladies is his “success""—someone as wealthy as him can take them anywhere they want to go.\n\nAgain, he’s hoping his girl is chill and down for whatever. Hanging on the West Coast requires a laid-back attitude, especially when it comes to smoking tons of weed.']]), ('Get high, baby, roll one\n Cloud nine ’bout to go up\n Lovin’ the feelin’ the turbulence get when we turn up\n When we land, we can roll out\n Show you somethin’ you ain’t know ’bout\n Tonight, we be takin’ off flight with a camera to show out', [['Jeremih is taking this girl places she’s never gone before. Weed is a potential aphrodisiac, and coupled with the pure ecstasy of the moment she reaches cloud nine, a feeling of absolute elation.\n\nThe origin of the phrase cloud nine is unknown; some speculate that it derives from the penultimate stage of the Bodhisattva—a Buddhist term for someone who is totally devoted to attaining spiritual enlightenment, which is reached after the completion of ten stages.\n\nThe turbulence is likely caused by their love-making as well by the air currents.']]), ('This one goes out to all sides worldwide\n Let that playa-ass nigga Thumpy be your guide\n As we go on a ride\n Where playa-hatin’ killers and hood niggas thrive\n And lame muh’fuckers can barely survive', [['The intro is interpolated from fellow Chi-town native Twista’s “It Feels So Good” which appeared on his 1997 album Adrenaline Rush.\n\n“Thumpy” alludes to the original title of the album, Thumpy Johnson (before it was renamed Late Nights). In a leaked tracklist, “Planez” still appeared as the album opener—this narrative would have served as the introduction to the album’s title character, however it was removed from the album version of the song.']]), ('Who you know make waves in the low tide?', [['Cole is a phenomenon that can make big things happen; his LP 2014 Forest Hills Drive demonstrates this. In a year where rap sales were low, he had the best first week numbers by far, making a big wave in the music industry. He compares this to a gust of wind that is strong enough to create huge waves when the water level is low.\n\n\n\nIt’s a common misconception that the moon is responsible for waves; in actuality, the wind causes the waves, while the moon is responsible for the tides.']]), ('Deebo’d yo bitch, now she both ours', [['Deebo was a neighborhood bully in the popular movie, Friday. In one of his most famous scenes, he gets Red to agree that the bike he stole can be “both ours” before knocking him out and keeping the bike. That’s how Cole plans to steal your girl.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFJThMDLYM4\n\nCole pronounced this line so that it can also be heard as both eyes, in reference to Deebo’s lazy eye.']]), ('Nigga, little brown liquor in my liver\n Pretty brown thing in my bed\n Been a long time since I had to ask for head\n So goddamn, don’t make me beg\n But I will if I need to, ’cause for real, girl, I need you', [['Since becoming a famous rapper, Cole no longer needs to ask women for sexual favors. However, this girl is special in that she isn’t offering anything to him, and instead forces him to ask for it, to “beg” her. He is clearly not happy about this, but will beg if necessary—he can’t do without her.\n\nThe girl in reference could be his fiancee (and now wife), Melissa Heholt.\n\nCole also loves his Hennessy, a brand of cognac that is often name-checked by rappers. Hennessy is a “brown liquor,” and referenced in Cole’s song “January 28th” when he raps: “I hope that we remember these nights fulla Hennessy.”']])]",-0.988,-0.988,0.3812,Aroused

You should be leaving

Maybe you could take me as your task

Don't let me overdose
Or it might be too bad
Cause if it doesn't last it will be all we ever had, yeah
I'll still hit you like tomorrow or the next day

I know how much you love to hate me
Don't underestimate me
I close my eyes and let you lead cause you're my favorite lady
