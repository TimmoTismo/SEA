[Verse 1]
Where am I supposed to be
Washed up, pushed out or on my feet?
Tell me is this a dream
Or am I stuck in a movie scene?

[Pre-Chorus]
Daily, lately
I'm spinnin' away, so crazy
So, baby, just take me

[Chorus]
I think I'm caught up in the way I feel 'bout you
I don't know how I can be so drawn into you
I think I'm fallin' in deep
I think I'm caught up in a wave of you, of you, mm

[Verse 2]
Oh, upside down, I'm tip-toein' under the sea
Lost and found, I hide in the memory
Crossing lines, am I gonna make it to the other side
Or do I have to chase it? (Oh)
Oh, I speak loud but don't hear my voice
Ten feet down, does it feel like choice?
Hanging onto the words you say
But еvery time I listen, I just hеar white noise
And all I see are these flashing lights
Can't hold, oh, while they're passing by
How many wrongs does it take to right?
How many wrongs does it take to right?
[Pre-Chorus]
Daily, lately
I'm spinnin' around, so crazy
So, baby, just take me

[Chorus]
I think I'm caught up in the way I feel 'bout you
I don't know how I can be so drawn into you
I think I'm fallin' in deep
I think I'm caught up in a wave of you, of you, mm

[Pre-Chorus]
Daily, lately
I'm spinnin' around, so crazy
So, baby, just take me (Oh)
Daily, lately
I'm spinnin' around, so crazy
So, baby, just take me

[Chorus]
I think I'm caught up in the way I feel 'bout you
I don't know how I can be so drawn into you
I think I'm fallin' in deep
I think I'm caught up in a wave of you, of you, mm",,-0.9269,-0.9269,0.3275,Happy

Spot a little hottie when I flipped out the shade
Lookin' like a red Rari sittin' in a driveway
Bottle of Cîroc with a hint of Kool-Aid
She done pulled up like I'm getting rid of weeds
Are you tired from running through my mind?
Take a break and we can have a good time
Show you moves like I'm the new James Brown
Me and you should get a room right now

[Pre-Chorus: Mikey]
'Cause if it's gold, I'll throw it away
You're worth more than every single chain
It ain't gon' work if you don't want it to
Best drink I take is when I'm sippin' you

[Chorus: Mikey]
You know where I go when we're dancing
Handshakes in The Hamptons and gettin' drunk in the mansions with you
And you look so classy, come through with that magic
You know that I'm 'bout to smash it, it's true

[Verse 2: Mikey]
I can take you to the room or I can take you to the beach
But we gotta leave at 9 'cause I gotta get my sleep
You can be the early bird, I'ma give you that worm
Get with me, I'll take you 'round the world

'Cause if it's gold, I'll throw it away
You're worth more than every single chain
Walk with a limp, it just means I'm cool
Next trip I take, it's just me and you

Lil Boat
You said you livin' up north when you comin' to the A
You said you need to find a crib, well, tell me where you wanna stay
I know we're not too pressed for time but can you pick up on the pace
I'm tired of looking at your pictures, wanna be up in your face
I wanna dance with you, I wanna laugh, I wanna sing
Take you on the road, have you rockin' on my bling
Don't know if you're the one, but if you are, you'll get a ring
That's later down the line, don't wanna rush these types of things
I'm a mama's boy so you gotta meet my mama first
As you whip the Coupe around, just use the seat belt first
New shoes, new clothes and a Chanel purse
Vacaying in The Hamptons got a lazy curse

In Harry’s August 2019 Rolling Stone cover interview, featured writer Kid Harpoon commented on the break-up:\n\nHe went through this breakup that had a big impact on him […] He had a whole emotional journey about her, this whole relationship.\n\nIn the same interview, Harry also discussed the books he’d recently been reading, confessing:\n\nReading didn’t really used to be my thing. I had such a short attention span. But I was dating someone who gave me some books; I felt like I had to read them because she’d think I was a dummy if I didn’t read them.\n\nWhen talking to Elle in February 2017, Camille revealed that one of her favourite books was “In Watermelon Sugar” by Richard Brautigan. The 1968 novel is set in a post-apocalyptic environment where individuals live in houses and wear clothing made of “watermelon sugar”, an element found by extracting the water out of watermelons, leaving the sugar behind.\n\nIn his March 2020 NPR Tiny Desk Concert Harry confirmed that the song’s title was inspired by “In Watermelon Sugar”:\n\nWe started some ideas and then I was with the guys that I made the first album with and we had this idea, this chorus melody, it was pretty repetitive. The Richard Brautigan book “In Watermelon Sugar” was on the table, and I was like ‘That’ll sound cool!’\n\nIn a November 2019 interview for Apple Music, Zane Lowe gave his own interpretation of the song:\n\nEveryone’s kind of figured out what it is about, the joys of mutually appreciated oral pleasure.

But the bridge, even more that, I think is still in character with the song in that when you go into a relationship and you don’t have any hesitations, and when you’re that young you don’t really have any baggage from other relationships. You kind of just are who you are, at that point, and you don’t really know if this person is going to be that one, you know? You don’t know how this is going to go, which is why the relationship is so exhilarating, and stuff. It’s like I’m going to go into this thing, I’m going to give it my all. I’m going to have fun with you, this is going to be great, but I don’t know how this is going to end. That part of the song, it’s an interesting part, but it is really just in the same vein of this is my first relationship. It was new, and I’m not in it now.

That’s okay. I just love you, and that’s actually what matters more. So, kiss me ‘til I’m sorry, I almost feel like that’s me realizing that the energy between us, the time between us, is more important than whatever we were just fighting about. It’s realizing like, “Oh, man, I’m actually really sorry that I did that, because this is so much more special than whatever the heck we were arguing about.

If you say something and somebody maybe laughs like a little longer than they typically do or then everybody else does or they look at you a little longer. Those are moments of vulnerability. And so I think that’s when you’re starting to get to know that person and people express feelings in different ways. Not everyone’s a hugger, not everyone’s a kisser, that’s just the way people are.

Other beneficiaries of Bieber’s time and/or money include the ACLU, PETA, and amfAR, an AIDS research charity to which Biebs donated $545,000 on a whim.\n\nIn February 2020, before the COVID-19 pandemic became an international crisis, Biebs donated $29,000 to Beijing Chunmiao Children Aid Foundation, sending a message of support on Instagram that foreshadowed the virus' worldwide impact:\n\nWatching the news I couldn’t imagine how scary it would be if a new disease was effecting [sic] my wife and my family and friends.

In December 2020, he teamed up with a London choir comprised of nurses, doctors, and other health care workers to record a version of his September 2020 hit “Holy.” The proceeds benefitted the UK’s National Health Service.

The “daydream crash” refers to the end of the movie, when the main character opts to exit the lucid dream by leaping off a skyscraper and “crashing” to the ground.\n\nIn the song, this lyric talks about how movies, television, and other streamed media can transport the watcher to a “better life” like a daydream, but as hard as one may try to stay in that dream, eventually it all comes crashing down as the watcher (like the character in Vanilla Sky) is pulled back to reality. The song’s music video also alludes to this, as it uses imagery of skyscrapers, and in the end the character is seen falling to the ground and fading away.\n\nThe lyric, “Do you? Do you?” conveys a sense of desperation; the singer is hoping that their companion experiences the same thing, and that they aren’t alone in feeling this way.']]), ('Like a thunder cloud in November rain\n Is the black dog out, runnin’ wild again\n For you, for you?', [['These lines are about depression.

Yeah

[Verse 1]
I've been tryna call
I've been on my own for long enough
Maybe you can show me how to love, maybe
I'm going through withdrawals
You don't even have to do too much
You can turn me on with just a touch, baby

I look around and
Sin City's cold and empty (Oh)
No one's around to judge me (Oh)
I can't see clearly when you're gone

[Chorus]
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night
Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust
Hey, hey, hey

I'm running out of time

That could imply a reminiscence of feelings he had in his (fictional) past life, and the fact that he’s very sensitive towards women, and has always been.\n\nThis idea is somewhat confirmed in the chorus.']]), ('I’m running out of time\n ’Cause I can see the sun light up the sky', [['This line has several meanings:\n\nFirst, he alludes to Las Vegas again. As mentioned in the pre-chorus of the song, Abel has a special emotional connection to the city. He recalls it here and automatically combines it with the chorus:\n\nNo, I can’t sleep until I feel your touch\n\nFurthermore, Vegas is a city, known for being “alive” at night. Another reason this song’s story, or the whole album takes place in Vegas are Abel’s\nrepeated references of it, adding to the fact, that he feels at home there.\n\nAbel fears, that he won’t be able to sleep, because he lost his loved one and needs to get her back to finally get sleep. At the end of his journey, he recalls this line. On “Final Lullaby”, the last track off the deluxe version of his album After Hours, Abel tries to accept the fact that he won’t find his love back in that night.\n\nI’m running out of time\nAnd you’ll always be on my mind\n\nAnother explanation could be his habit to be awake late at night, as already mentioned in “Alone Again”:\n\nI’m falling only for the night\n\nA possible reason for him being stressed during the day is his fame and popularity. During the day, Abel is blinded by the lights of police cars, but also by flashing camera lights, representing fame. Therefore, he likes to escape into the night, just like in his record “Snowchild”:\n\nLeaving, leaving into the night\nNow a nigga leaving, leaving\nLeaving into the night, oh']]), ('I’m going through withdrawals', [['A “withdrawal” can both mean the behavior in which one prefers to be alone or also the physical and mental effects experienced when a person stops using a drug. Considering Abel’s historic of drug abuse, which is largely mentioned in his songs, the second one is more likely.\n\nMoreover, in a 2016 interview with The Guardian he referred to the subject:\n\nWhen I had nothing to do but make music, it was very heavy. Drugs were a crutch for me.']]), ('So I hit the road in overdrive, baby, oh', [[""Here, Abel alludes to his habit of driving over the speed limit, which he has mentioned in several songs in the past, such as on “Heartless,”“ featured on his fourth studio album, After Hours:\n\nI’ve been dodgin' death in the six-speed\n\nAbel also admits his love for dangerous speeding on his September 2016 single “Starboy”\n\n100 on the dash get me close to God\n\n“Blinding Lights” was also originally teased in a German Mercedes-Benz commercial, where The Weeknd is shown driving an electric car while the song plays in the background.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C83VEu-yuYA""]]), ('I’ve been tryna call', [['The first line of this song represents Abel’s vulnerability. A theme explored throughout the rest of this song. On the song “Coming Down,” Abel expresses very similar feelings:\n\nPick up your phone\nThe party’s finished and I want you to know\nI’m all alone\n\nWithout drugs, Abel feels a sense of loneliness. This is perhaps Abel’s truest and most authentic self.']]), ('I said, ooh, I’m blinded by the lights\n No, I can’t sleep until I feel your touch\n I said, ooh, I’m drowning in the night\n Oh, when I’m like this, you’re the one I trust\n Hey, hey, hey', [['This song directly follows the outro of “Faith,” where The Weeknd speaks about being in the back of a police car presumably after an overdose:\n\nI ended up in the back of a flashing car\nWith the city shining on my face\nThe lights are blinding me again\n\nThe “lights” here not only represent the lights from the police car or the city but also the fame Abel’s enjoyed for his recording career. From stage lights to paparazzi camera flashes, he’s been “blinded” by many examples of a wealthy and successful life, and he doesn’t plan on stopping anytime soon. However, his celebrity life often overshadows his deep personal life. On his 2018 song “Privilege,” Abel discusses how many fans and media sources didn’t believe that he could have a real and genuine relationship with a partner because of his status in fame:\n\nThey said our love is just a game, I don’t care what they say\n\nNevertheless, his relationship seems to be real and sound, as he claims that it is the only thing that can keep him peacefully inserted in this lifestyle.\n\nAbel also uses a similar line on “Snowchild,” the fifth track from After Hours:\n\nLeaving, leaving into the night\nNow a nigga leaving, leaving\nLeaving into the night, oh']]), ('I’ve been on my own for long enough', [['Abel’s been on his own since around the age of 17 when he dropped out of high school and left home to never come back. This is referenced on many of his songs, like “Rolling Stone,” from his mixtape Thursday, where he said:\n\n‘Cause I’ve been on these streets way too long, too long, too long\nBaby, I’ve been on this too long\n\nHe’s also implying that he has been single for quite some time now and has forgotten how to love. From 2015 to 2019 Abel and model Bella Hadid had an on and off relationship, and after spending a few months apart, Abel seems to have lost his ability to love.\n\nTo add on, throughout After Hours, Abel plays with the idea of being “alone together” or simply “alone” on songs like “Save Your Tears”, “Faith,” and the opening track “Alone Again:”\n\n‘Cause I don’t know if I can be alone again\nI don’t know if I can be alone again']]), ('I look around and\n Sin City’s cold and empty (Oh)\n No one’s around to judge me (Oh)\n I can’t see clearly when you’re gone', [['Las Vegas is nicknamed “Sin City” due to the city’s overwhelming presence of crime, drugs, and sexual promiscuity—all important themes throughout The Weeknd’s career. He also explores hedonism on his August 2011 song “Heaven or Las Vegas.”\n\nAbel experienced emptiness and heartbreak when he was briefly separated from Bella Hadid in 2019. The two have since reunited and emotionally completed The Weeknd.\n\nAbel previously touched upon his need for Bella on his November 2019 single, “Heartless”:\n\nYou just came back in my life\nYou never gave up on me (Why don’t you?)\nI’ll never know what you see (Why won’t you?)\nI don’t do well when alone (Oh yeah)']]), ('I’m just calling back to let you know (Back to let you know)\n I could never say it on the phone (Say it on the phone)\n Will never let you go this time (Ooh)', [['This line is very similar to the song “Heartless,” released just days before this song. Here, Abel describes how his love for whom is presumed to be Bella Hadid is much stronger than he can say on the phone to her. This is different than the feelings Abel has shown in previous albums, with his typical themes usually revolving around never showing love towards anyone he is with and only using them for sex.']])]",-0.4434,-0.4434,0.3251,Happy

So, it’s kind of like come on. Bring a few of your mates, we bring a few of ours. Let’s go back and have a little drink and then, die of a hangover the next day. And yeah, just kind of, we’ve been trips and around the bars of Soho for the evening, let’s go back and have a house party. So that’s basically what that means to me.']]), ('Nice to meet ya, what’s your name?\n Let me treat ya to a drink', [['I’m actually quite, generally quite useless talking to women, I get too nervous. And overthink it. And just, already go into the conversation with a bad mindset just like, “Oh, you can’t do this, you’re not very good at this. Just don’t say the wrong thing.” The usual, and you think that you’re the only person that thinks that. Even though, they’re all thinking the same thing. I like stuff to happen naturally, I’m never going to force it.']]), ('(I got love for you)\n (I got love for you)', [['Love sounded a bit better than lust. It’s kind of like, “I’ve only just met you, but there’s something about you, and I just have to scream it out. That’s why I kind of tucked it in the background. Like, ""I love you.” Like a, “Praise the Lord.” I really like screaming at the top of my lungs that there’s something about you, and that’s what I think “I got love for you” means.']]), ('’Cause when the morning comes, I know you won’t be there\n Every time I turn around, you disappear', [['When you’re out, and it’s kind of loud, and it’s crazy, and you’ve clearly got chatting, and then you were chatting to your friends about the chat you just had with her, and then she’s probably doing the same, and it just feels like the night is getting a little bit disjointed? So I kind of had that in my head. You have a few drinks and everything gets a bit spacey, and you’re like, “Whoa.” Then yeah, you just kind of get that feeling that you’re not going to see her again, even though you really want to.']]), ('I’m gonna take you somewhere warm, you know j’adore la mer', [[""The French thing, the speaking of the French was me kind of making it a little bit more colorful. And I mean, I love the sea, the direct translation, it’s probably not the best thing of all time, but if you speak in French, j'adore la mer, everything just sounds a little bit sexier in French. So you just turned up that little heat button a little bit. And apparently people like it.""]]), ('I wanna blow your mind, just come with me, I swear', [['It’s like when you meet someone, you’re like, “I don’t want to be like the last guy you were with. I might not blow your mind, but I want to like give it a go, you know, do stuff with you that you wouldn’t have done before.” When I get to the French speaking part, I mean, just let’s go traveling. Let’s go to France and sit by the sea. Just like ‘cause I’m quite a spontaneous person, and at the drop of a hat, I’m ready to go wherever you want me to go. So I would like the idea of that, to bring in the spontaneity into meeting someone for the first time, and just kind of going, “Do you want to go to Paris?” I kind of like the idea of it.']]), ('’Cause when the morning comes, I know you won’t be there\n Every time I turn around, you disappear', [['I guess the whole idea of waking the next morning, kind of looking over and them not being there. It’s kind of like, as you said, like a nod to that cheeky side of the song and what the song is about, and kind of elaborating on something so simple as going, “Oh, where have they gone?”']]), ('I want your number tattooed on my arm in ink, I swear', [['Literally like the thing about this particular scenario is that I knew she a bit about her, and it was not a phone thing. She literally wrote it on a piece of paper. And we were chit-chatting about it, and she’s like, “Hey, let’s go and hang out.” And I thought that was, in a world where we’re like looking at your phone, everyone showing numbers, swapping contacts, all this, and I like the idea of the actual physical piece of paper with a number on it. But I would never, I’ve never felt that strongly about it. But when I was writing the lyric, I liked the visual of it. You know, literally, music video type stuff where like looking over the arm, and it’s got like a phone number on it. I just thought it was a quite colorful lyric.']]), ('I like the way you talk, I like the things you wear', [['I don’t think I’ve got a major type. I do like someone that looks like they’ve got a bit of character about them. You know, like maybe this girl on Tumblr, she had tattoos and I think she had like pink in her hair. She was really a quite cool looking chick, and our chat was really, she was really funny. And yeah, she was just like … I like people that just have a bit about them and can give you a bit back. You know, like if I’m ripping the piss a little bit, if you don’t mind me saying, they can hand it back a little bit. And I kind of like someone that can take it and also give it, it’s good.

The artist is saying that they’re too old already to learn how to do or be anything new, so why even bother?\nIt also highlights their dissatisfaction with their current situation, where they feel they’re too young to give up but too old to learn. Being in that awkward in between is uncomfortable so they want to get away from it all.']]), ('Put quinoa in my fridge', [['In an interview with Billboard, Ryan Metzger said “The quinoa line in ‘Bang!’ is pretty apt.

With the great success of Neotheater and the difference its music has from The Click, this could just be saying they’re done with  the pop that they have repeatedly used. They might just be saying they’re going out with a Bang. They are coming out of their skin and knocking down all barriers we thought they were held back by by changing everything. The difference between bang and My play are exponentially different in the base that it is getting way more personal and deep, and more changes.']]), ('So ooh-dee-la-dee-doe\n Yeah, come on here we go', [['At this part in the music video, the people are in uniform and are moving all together.

One of the lines in “Karma” is: “Wait, don’t go away, can I lie here forever?”.

Tryna find my way back to you 'cause I'm needin'
A little bit of love
A little bit of love, a little bit of love

[Verse 1]
Lately I've been countin' stars
And I'm sorry that I broke your heart
It's somethin' that I didn't want for you
But I'm steppin' on broken glass
And I know this is my final chance
All I'm tryna do is find my path to you

I've got voices in my head and there's a deafening silence
I've got voices in my head and I can't lie

Tryna find my way back to you 'cause I'm needin'

A little bit of love, a little bit of love, a little bit of love

Lately, I've been wakin' up
In a dreamy state calling your name
Stayed up too late just thinkin' of you
Now I'm knocking on every door
'Cause I heard you moved from twenty-two
Has it been that long? I guess time just flew

While Heaven is where good people o, Hell is a punishlent for those who have sinned. However, this imagery first appeared in Dante’s Divine Comedy in 1320. According to Wikipedia, ‘The poem’s imaginative vision of the afterlife is representative of the medieval world-view as it had developed in the Western Church by the 14th century. It helped establish the Tuscan language, in which it is written, as the standardized Italian language. It is divided into three parts: Inferno, Purgatorio, and Paradiso.’ Basically, Christians have appropriated this idea and made it their own. In several icons, we can see angels in heaven and the devil (Lucifer, the fallen angel) in hell.\n\n\n\nHeaven being a place of sanity and peace, Ava is asking heaven what is better for her to do. Asking heaven is purely religious and although we know nothing about the singer’s beliefs, as an American, it is possible that she is christian.\n\nFurthermore, asking the heavens for an advice can be a metaphor to say asking our guardian angel. Christian people believe that every person made by God has a guardian angel that is with them everywhere, everytime. He is a confident and an adviser.']]), ('Lost my mind in your arms, I go to extremes, yeah\n When angels tell me run, and monsters call it love, oh', [['Here again, Ava Max displays duality, a concept that runs her first album. Angels and monsters are the complete opposite. One lives in heaven and represents peace while the other lives in hell and is usually used to depict fear and anger, tying into the album’s title of Heaven & Hell–an album whose primary focus is duality. Additionally, several interviews find the Ava confessing that duality runs her life.\n\nThis also relates back to “Torn,” a song release prior to the album:\n\nI’m torn in-between Heaven and Hell']]), ('And then I picture all the perfect that we lived\n ’Til I cut the strings on your tiny violin, oh woah', [[""Apparently, their relationship was perfect until some point.\n\nAccording to the Urban Dictionary, A Tiny Violin is ‘When someone is complaining about something that is dumb, doesn’t matter, or you just don’t care about at all’.\n\nFurthermore, ‘'Cut the strings’ means that ‘you are being “real” and not fantasizing or dreaming about something. Being a puppet means that you are not responsible, not a man, always dreaming about unrealistic things. Cutting the strings means you stop and think rationally about something.’'\n\nAva Max has several songs about leaving a toxic relationship, and in this one, she seems to deal with freeing herself from that person’s control. That person treated her as a puppet, played with her but wasn’t being serious about them being together. She is down to earth, realistic, and admits that them being together was not meant to last.
