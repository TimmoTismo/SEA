Good day in my mind, safe to take a step out
Get some air now, let yo edge out
Too soon, I spoke
You be heavy in my mind, can you get the heck out?
I need rest now, got me bummed out
You so, you so, you
Baby, baby, babe
I've been on my empty mind shit

[Pre-Chorus: SZA]
I try to keep from losin' the rest of me
I worry that I wasted the best of me on you, babe
You don't care
Said, ""Not tryna be a nuisance, this is urgent""
Tryna make sense of loose change
Got me a war in my mind
Gotta let go of weight, can't keep what's holdin' me
Choose to watch while the world break up in front of me

[Chorus: SZA, Jacob Collier & Both]
All the while, I'll await my armored fate with a smile
I still wanna try, still believe in
Good days, good days, always
Always inside (Always in my mind, always in my mind, mind)
Good day living in my mind

[Verse 2: SZA, Jacob Collier]
Tell me I'm not my fears, my limitations
I disappear if you let me
Feelin' like, yeah (On your own)
Feelin' like Jericho
Feelin' like Job when he lost his shit
Gotta hold my own, my cross to bear alone, I
Ooh, played and dipped, way to kill the mood
Know you like that shit
Can't groove it, ba-baby
Heavy on my empty mind shit

[Pre-Chorus: SZA]
I gotta keep from losin' the rest of me (Rest of me)
Still worry that I wasted the best of me on you, babe
You don't care
Said, ""Not tryna be a nuisance, this is urgent"" (It's urgent)
Tryna make sense of loose change
Got me a war in my mind (My mind)
Gotta let go of weight, can't keep what's holdin' me
Choose to watch while the world break up in front of me

[Chorus: SZA, Jacob Collier & Both]
All the while, I'll await my armored fate with a smile
I still wanna try, still believe in
Good days, good days, always (Good days on my mind, good days on my mind)
Sunny inside (Always in my mind, always in my mind, mind)
Good day living in my mind

[Verse 3: SZA]
Gotta get right
Tryna free my mind before the end of the world
I don't miss no ex, I don't miss no text
I choose not to respond
I don't regret, just pretend shit never happened
Half of us layin' waste to our youth, it's in the present
(Na-na, na-na, na-na, na)
Half of us chasin' fountains of youth and it's in the present now

[Outro: Jacob Collier]
Always in my mind, always in my mind, mind
You've been making me feel like I'm
Always in my mind, always in my mind, mind","[('Good day in my mind, safe to take a step out', [['Following the release of the Good Days Fan Video, SZA took to the comments to share her meaning behind the line:\n\nGood days is a mantra, More than than a belief.\nGood days is about not being sure .. not Sure hope is still a thing, not sure better is coming, not sure any of even it matters . its an acknowledgement were all in the same ugly chaotic beautiful existence . Shared energy . We’re all  shattered and stretched beyond our means in all Ways.  Good days is a reminder we’re all struggling find and feel A Connection. To believe everyday has the tiniest possibility to be better than the last is what It’s all about. Possibility !! A SLIVER of hope.. not even a whole lot.  A reminder to OURSELVES .. that a sliver is sometimes all u need . I wanna say thank you for sharing your life w me . Your emotions , your darkness, and light. For crying and laughing and committing to being in the moment w me . It’s hard and I’m proud of you . love you beyond measure and Thank you for contributing to one of The greatest moments of my life . I never wanna stop Creating and Sharing moments w you … even if they suck …even if Good days aren’t on the horizon .. I’m honored to spend them with you… forever love !\nP.S. OFFICIAL GOOD DAYS MUSIC VIDEO WILL BE OUT ASAP !']]), ('Too soon, I spoke\n You be heavy in my mind, can you get the heck out?', [['In the previous line, SZA seems to be in a good headspace. However, this doesn’t last long when she is reminded of her previous lover. She can’t stop thinking about them, but she wishes she could.']]), ('Get some air now, let yo edge out', [['This verse captures the complex and relatable sentiment that rest is often justified but simultaneously difficult to embrace. Accordingly, SZA could be using the word “edge” here in a couple of ways. For instance, letting one’s edge out may refer to allowing oneself to relax or feel relief. It could also refer to “edges”: small fly-away hairs that might be pressed onto the forehead with gel. Here, she gives herself permission to relax, to release the edges from their binding gel. Both meanings in this potential double entendre illustrate the idea that relief is difficult to maintain in the face of “heavy”, intolerable emotions. In this line, she claims that she is relieved before admitting in the following line that she spoke too soon.']]), ('I don’t miss no ex, I don’t miss no text\n I choose not to respond', [[""SZA most popularly once ignored a text from WESTSIDE BOOGIE, as he details on his song, “Self Destruction.”\n\n‘Til the time I fuck a singer, I can’t say that I’m that guy\nLike that night I drunk text SZA, she ain’t reply, whoa\n\nWESTSIDE BOOGIE also breaks down the significance of the verses and what happened the night when he messaged SZA:\n\nI'ma tell y'all the SZA story, and it’s gonna be the first, probably, and only time I say it. So I was at Coachella, right. I was with my big homie G-Weeder, and I saw SZA. He got a close relationship with TDE because he like big in the streets. He introduces me. And that whole night, because she told me she fuck with my music, the whole night he told me, like, “Bro, I feel like you could pull her, bro.” He gassing me up like, “Bro, I feel like you can get SZA. I want somebody to get her.” Like, he’s telling me. Like, no disrespect to SZA, because she a queen, but you feel me that night, I left Coachella, I text her like, I think I said something about her music, how I’m a fan. She told me she fuck with my music too. Then the next message was like, me just trying to link. It wasn’t any like super, super thirst. In my mind, I was being thirsty, like if we link, I’m gonna try to slide on her, but I played it cool like I’m just trying to link with you and work, but she didn’t reply to me, so. Shout out to SZA, though. That’s still my dog.\nI hope I didn’t blow my chance for a feature with SZA by being thirsty. That’s just a reality.""]]), ('You’ve been making me feel like I’m', [['Jacob Collier interpolates this line from his August 2020 track “In Too Deep,” which features fellow American R&B singer-songwriter Kiana Ledé:\n\nYou been making me feel like I’m lonely, baby\nI don’t know what I did wrong']]), ('Half of us layin’ waste to our youth, it’s in the present\n (Na-na, na-na, na-na, na)\n Half of us chasin’ fountains of youth and it’s in the present now', [['These lines could allude to last track of CTRL “20 Somethings,” which addresses the feelings of discouragement due to growing into adulthood. SZA now emphasizes the value of recognizing your youth and enjoying it despite growing into older age.']]), ('My cross to bear alone, I', [['The phrase cross to bear  refers to a burden or trial that one must endure, alluding to the cross carried by Jesus on the way to his own crucifixion. However SZA has no aid in dealing with the weight of her emotional burden as she carries it alone.']]), ('Said, “Not tryna be a nuisance, this is urgent”\n Tryna make sense of loose change', [['SZA creates a clever play on words by using the using the homophones “sense"" and “cents.”  She implies that she is trying to understand the sporadic and minimal communication her lover has given her. This lack of contact represents “loose change,” a combination here of coins and partial understanding. A similar double meaning appears on the chorus to DJ Quik’s 1995 hit “Dollaz + Sense”:\n\nIf it don’t make dollars, it don’t make sense\n\nRegardless of SZA’s efforts to add up the pieces, she still cannot come up with the complete, total amount. As a result, she needs to have a conversation as soon as possible to stop from  overthinking.']]), ('All the while, I’ll await my armored fate with a smile', [['SZA calls her fate “armored” because she is trying to get herself behind the idea that no one has authority over her future: it is protected. All she can do is be happy with what she has because there is nothing she can control about tomorrow except how she feels.\n\nIn an interview with the Breakfast Club, about her previous album Ctrl, she said:\n\nIf you try to control a future moment, it’s impossible. There’s no such thing as control anyway. It’s just a concept, a word, a fantasy. But if you focus on the way you feel in the now and what you do with the now, I feel like it leads to having true control in the future.\n\n\n\nSZA in an interview with the Breakfast Club. Charlamagne tha God is on the left. \n\n\nSZA confirmed the lyric on twitter writing:\nhttps://twitter.com/sza/status/1302673765806100480?s=20']]), ('Feelin’ like, yeah (On your own)\n Feelin’ like Jericho', [['This lyric is a reference to the Battle of Jericho in the biblical Book of Joshua in which the Israelites marched around the city-state of Jericho, persevering until its walls fell down.\n\nSZA uses this simile to describe that her safety or sense of control is falling just like the walls of Jericho.']])]",0.8209,0.8209,0.4284,Chill

I'll keep the pictures saved in a safe place
Wow, I look so weird here
My face has changed now
It's a big shame
So many feelings, struggling to leave my mouth
And it's not that rare for me to let myself down
In a big way
But I had enough time and I found enough reason to accept that

[Chorus]
It's not the same anymore
I lost the joy in my face
My life was simple before
I should be happy, of course
But things just got much harder
Now it's just hard to ignore

It's not the same anymore
It's not the same, but it's not a shame 'cause

I spend a long time putting up with people
Putting on my best face
It's only normal when you stop things in the wrong way
It's only four o'clock and still, it's been a long day
I just wanna hit the hay
People knocking on me like every day
I'm tired of taking stress
If only there could be another way
I'm tired of feeling suppressed
And when they want me the most
I'm tired of acting like I care, but I do
And I can't wait to hit the bed
But tomorrow makes me scared

I open up when shit gets built up this high
She makes it easy to cry
The words fall out of me and there's no more disguise
I miss the days when I was someone else
I used to be so hungry
Right now, my stomach's full as hell
And I've spent many months just hating on myself
I can't keep wishing things will be different
Or leaving problems on the shelf
I wish I didn't need to get help
But I do
But I do
Oh-oh-oh

[Verse 4]
I been so hard on myself, yeah
Even my family can tell
And they barely saw what I felt
I wouldn't wish this on my enemy or anyone else

I've learned so much from before
Now I'm not short on advice
There's no excuses at all
No point in feeling upset
Won't take my place on the floor
I'll stand up straight like I'm tall
It's up to me, no one else
I'm doing this for myself

You're my painkiller

Feel like the one, but I'm one in a billion
Teenage cynical, and I don't really know
What's the point of livin' if my heart gets broken?
Drivin' on the road, waiting for head-on collision
Springtime funeral
I miss you, but I'd rather be alone
To keep me from

Are we in too deep to take it all back?

[Chorus]
I like it when you love me
I like it when you care
I like it when it's easy
And there ain't all this bad blood here
Don't like it when you hurt me
Don't like when you swear
Just like it when you love me
I like it when you love me, love me
I like it when you love me, love me

[Outro]
I like it when you love me, love me
I like it when you love me, love me",,-0.9737,-0.9737,0.1745,Chill

I would need a million words
If I tried to define
All the things you mean to me, yeah
For you, I'd die a thousand lives

’Cause love is born when hearts collide
Every time you touch me
You remind me that I'm still alive

So promise you'll never change
And I’ll always be the same
We'll be dancing the same groove when we're ninety-two
The same as seventeen
And I'll never lie to you
Just don't you hold back on me
I wanna love you as strong when we're ninety-two
The same as seventeen

I don't really know what's right
But I could never call you wrong
I just wanna dance wit’ you
Floatin’ over marble floors
You're something like an angel
You do something to my mind
I could see a thousand years
When I’m lookin' in your eyes

And I’m not talking about relationships, I’m talking about everything. I could never be alone. I couldn’t take my own company. I just felt like I needed that growth. I needed a moment to myself and I got it. It was hard, it’s so much harder than you think to not rely on people, to just have yourself to rely on.

I don’t know how to put it without actually saying it, and I don’t want to actually say it. But it was me admitting to something that was very serious about my depression. A very serious step that I was admitting that I was planning on taking and Finneas said, ‘I don’t want to write a song about you killing yourself and how that’s everything you wanted!’\n\nBillie has previously addressed her depression in a September 2019 interview at the Grammy Museum:\n\nThe last two years were the worst mentally for me… I had these crazy things happening all around me and I was not there for them because of my brain and because of the things that my brain was telling me… To be honest with you, I didn’t think I would make it to this age and I have and I waited and here I am and I’m happier than I’ve ever been in my life.\n\nIn her debut March 2019 album, WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP, WHERE DO WE GO?, Billie also discusses similar themes, like sleep paralysis and lucid dreams. In a February 2019 interview with NME, she revealed:\n\nThe album [WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP, WHERE DO WE GO?] is basically what happens when you fall asleep. For me, in every song in the album there’s sleep paralysis. There’s night terrors, nightmares, lucid dreams….I’ve always had really, really bad night terrors. I’ve had sleep paralysis five times. All my dreams are lucid so I control them. I know that I’m dreaming what I’m dreaming, so I don’t even know. Sometimes I’ll have dreams where the thing that was in my dream will happen the next day. It’s so weird. It’s so weird.']]), ('I tried to scream\n But my head was underwater\n They called me weak\n Like I’m not just somebody’s daughter\n Coulda been a nightmare', [[""In continuation with the content of the first verse, Billie finds herself under the water of the Golden Gate Bridge, aware of those who label her as weak, a negative term insensitively applied to suicide victims. Contrary to popular opinion, Billie did not record the line, “but my head was underwater,” underwater. Instead, they applied an underwater sound effect to her vocals.\n\nThis line also parallels another line from Billie’s January 2019 song, “bury a friend,” where she sings about sleep paralysis:\n\nThe debt I owe, gotta sell my soul\n‘Cause I can’t say no, no, I can’t say no\nThen my limbs all froze and my eyes won’t close\nAnd I can’t say no, I can’t say no\n\nIn a November 2018 Instagram livestream, Billie talked about her experience with sleep paralysis:\n\nI tried to look around, and my head wouldn’t move. And I kept moving my arm… but my arm wouldn’t fucking move […] and I did what your brain tells your leg to do but that shit did not move. So I was like… shit this is fucked. I tried to scream “Mom” [and I couldn’t scream]. It was the scariest shit in my life. Also, I didn’t know what sleep paralysis was, so I was like “I’m dying, this is it bro, I’m gone, bye.” I didn’t even get to say goodbye to all the people I love.\n\nBeing unable to move limbs or speak are common symptoms of sleep paralysis. However, some people experience terrifying hallucinations in combination with sleep paralysis, which may trigger feelings of helplessness. In a March 2019 interview with Fader, Billie also revealed that she experiences both terrifying nightmares and dreams that are too good to be true:\n\nI’m sure somebody’s gonna be like, ‘oh, it’s your brain doing this,’ but, like, you cannot give me a good explanation. I do not understand. Dreams are a really intense part of my life. I’ll go through a month where I’ll have the same nightmare every single night—a dream that’s so bad that the whole day is off, or a dream that’s so good that none of it’s true.\n\nThe lyric may also allude to lyrics in Phoebe Bridgers' 2017 track, “Funeral:”\n\nAnd I have this dream where I’m screaming underwater\nWhile my friends are waving from the shore""]]), ('And you say, ”As long as I’m here, no one can hurt you\n Don’t wanna lie here, but you can learn to\n If I could change the way that you see yourself\n You wouldn’t wonder why you hear\n ‘They don’t deserve you’”', [['Billie spoke about the strong relationship she has with her brother FINNEAS in a November 2019 interview with BBC Radio 1:\n\nmy brother is my best friend and I have these dreams and these things happen and no matter what happens he’s gonna always be there for me and it’s the same the other way around.\n\nShe also sent the following message to her fans via email:']]), ('Thought I could fly (Fly)\n So I stepped off the Golden, mm\n Nobody cried (Cried, cried, cried, cried)\n Nobody even noticed\n I saw them standing right there\n Kinda thought they might care (Might care, might care)', [[""The Golden Gate Bridge, which is depicted on the song’s cover art, is the second-most used suicide site in the world behind the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge in China. People have been known to travel to San Francisco specifically to jump off the bridge, and since the bridge’s opening in 1937, there have been more than 1,700 confirmed suicides and 300 unconfirmed. Interestingly, a safety net under the bridge is to be completed by 2021. In a February 2019 interview with Annie Mac, Billie stated:\n\nWe started writing it because I literally had a dream that I killed myself and nobody cared and all of my best friends basically came out in public and said ‘oh, we never liked her’ […]\n\n\n\nIn Billie’s March 2019 song, “listen before i go”, she describes a similar scenario:\n\nTake me to the rooftop\nI wanna see the world when I stop breathing\nTurnin' blue\nTell me love is endless, don’t be so pretentious\nLeave me like you do (Like you do)""]])]",0.5204,0.5204,0.2534,Chill

Here, she sings:\n\nIt’s never too late\nTo leave if you wanna leave (Better Not)\nOr to stay if you wanna stay\n\nOn “Chemtrails Over The Country Club”, Lana expresses similar sentiments, describing the uncertainty of love and the fragility, or perhaps superficiality, of summer flings. However, this time, she’s willing to keep love alive, no matter how unlikely the situation may seem.']]), ('The Brentwood Market', [['This line is a reference to the Brentwood Country Mart, a local shopping village in Los Angeles.\n\nDel Rey mentioned the shopping village in an interview with Annie Mac on January 11th, 2021, where she explained:\n\nIf I go to the Brentwood Country Mart barefoot or whatever, it’s like, I’m not insane, I’m connected to the earth. Whatever it may be.”']]), ('I’m not unhinged or unhappy, I’m just wild', [['On the Paradise song “Ride” back in 2012, she called herself:\n\nI’m tired of feeling like I’m fucking crazy\nI’m tired of driving ‘til I see stars in my eyes\nAll I’ve got to keep myself sane, baby\nSo I just ride, I just ride\n\n\n\nAnd on the Norman Fucking Rockwell! cut “hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have – but i have it”, she sings the lines:\n\nDon’t ask if I’m happy\nYou know that I’m not\nBut at best you can see I’m not sad\n\n\n\nIn Chemtrails Over the Country Club, she seems to be continuing to discover more about herself and finding a balance between the two extremes.']]), ('We’re in our jewels in the swimming pool', [[""In these lines, Lana nods to the little expressions of luxury she allows herself. Usually, one removes jewelry and other valuables before swimming, but leaving them on presents a subtle show of one’s pride or personal wealth, a common theme throughout Lana’s musical aesthetic.\n\nIn the first line of Verse 1, Lana continues this theme, painting a picture of getting all dressed up to visit everyday places like the market or kids' swimming pools.""]]), ('Under the chemtrails over the country club', [['Here, Lana references chemtrails, the colloquially-named condensation trails left in the sky by high-flying aircrafts, which are also the subject of a popular conspiracy theory. While scientists generally agree that such patterns are formed by the breakage of moisture in the atmosphere combined with various gases from aircraft exhaust, conspiracy theorists think that they contain chemical or biological agents used nefariously by the government; hence, chemtrails.\n\nReferencing them directly in her lyrics is a personification of this attitude of being “blissfully aware” as she turns a conspiracy into simply something that is pretty to look at.\n\n\n\nContrails, or chemtrails\n\n\nCountry clubs are private, member-only clubs that offer golf, dining, and other entertaining facilities. They can be exclusive and luxurious, exuding wealth and leisure.']]), ('I’m on the run with you, my sweet love', [['With this first line, Lana sets the mood for an evocative, minimalist track with a production similar to that of her last album, Norman Fucking Rockwell!, but with a theme that harkens back to those of romance and escapism she’s been exploring since her debut album Born to Die.\n\nThis time, however, the tone and production takes a significantly different twist. Here, Lana sounds less reckless, with a coyer, more mature, and contemplative tone.\n\nThroughout the previously mentioned albums, Lana paints herself as a careless and dependent woman, running from man to man and struggling on finding true love. In “Chemtrails”, Lana expresses her happiness and her freedom.\n\nFor example, in “Diet Mountain Dew”, Lana expresses the fragility of her relationship by asking a question:\n\nNever was there ever a girl so pretty\nDo you think we’ll be in love forever?\nDo you think we’ll be in love?\n\nIn “Chemtrails”, Lana expresses her happiness and her freedom. She also references living in the moment and being with those you love, whoever that may be.']]), ('Nobody’s son, nobody’s daughter', [['This line may refer to Lana’s 2012 track “Body Electric”, where she sings:\n\nElvis is my daddy\nMarilyn’s my mother\n\nThis also ties back to her earlier song “Ride”, where Lana appears free, but uncertain. Here, however, on “Chemtrails”, Lana may be moving on from that state of mind, fully accepting all aspects of her freedom and being able to maintain it even in a relationship.\n\nAt the start of the song, Lana sings “I’m on the run, with you my sweet love” so being “nobody’s son, nobody’s daughter” could allude that she is on the run, leaving her old life as Lizzy Grant.']]), ('There’s nothing wrong contemplating God', [['Throughout Del Rey’s music, there are many conflicting ideas to do with religion and God.\n\nIn this lyric, Del Rey defends herself, saying\n\nThere’s nothing wrong with contemplating God\n\nFor example, on the 9th track of her 5th studio album Lust for Life, “Coachella – Woodstock in My Mind”, Del Rey mentions many ideas about meeting Jesus.\n\nI’d trade it all for a stairway to heaven (A stairway, stairway to heaven)\nI’d take my time for the climb up to the top of it (A stairway)\nI’d trade the fame and the fortune and the legend (A stairway)\nI’d give it all away if you give me just one day to ask Him one question\nI’d give it all away if you give me just one day to ask Him one question\n\nLana shows herself to be selfless – proving herself to be willing to sacrifice everything she has to ask God just one question.\n\nAnd on “Diet Mountain Dew”, from Born To Die, Del Rey says:\n\nLet’s take Jesus off the dashboard\nGot enough on His mind\n\nOften people have Jesus figures in their car dashboards to remind them that God is watching over them. Lana wants to remove this so she’s not reminded how far she has strayed from a moral path in life.\n\nIn addition, Lana was raised Roman Catholic by her parents. In a 2012 interview with The Telegraph, she mentions having a struggle with her belief and spirituality:\n\nWhen I was very young I was sort of floored by the fact that my mother and my father and everyone I knew was going to die one day, and myself too. I had a sort of a philosophical crisis. I couldn’t believe that we were mortal. For some reason that knowledge sort of overshadowed my experience. I was unhappy for some time. I got into a lot of trouble. I used to drink a lot. That was a hard time in my life.\n\nThroughout much of her music, due to her teenage years, Lana Del Rey speaks to her conflict with God and how on one hand she believes God is real and exists, but on other she accepts that God may be dead. She, especially in “Chemtrails Over the Country Club”, is always having a conflict with her ideals or values and the values of those around her. Many may feel that her disbelieving in God is terrible, while others may be saying her belief in God is terrible. By saying “There’s nothing wrong in contemplating God”, Lana opens the door to personal reflection and thought.']]), ('White picket', [['After World War II, cookie cutter houses and mass produced housing developments like Levittowns began popping up across the U.S. The features of these developments and homes, like white picket fences, became iconic symbols of the middle-class white American domestic life. Lana references white picket fences to show the listener what she wants: her American dream of domesticity.']])]",0.9923,0.9923,0.4488,Chill

Only fools rush in
And I can't help falling in love with you

I wonder if I'm ever on her mind like she's on mine
Probably not
Swear I've never seen a girl so fine
She probably got tons of guys tryna hit her line
And take her time, I guess I better step in line
She got me shook
Fell in love on the first look typical
Always catching feelings when the feelings not reciprocal
Love is just so difficult
Builds you up then tears you down
Every time she comes around

Acting cool for her
She's too bad for me
But I'm too good for her

Yeah, I tend to fall in love with every pretty girl I see practically
But how come they never fall in love with me, I mean gee; pardon me
But I'm better than those assholes you talk to
Who claim that they got you, but clearly that's not true
I feel the vibe between us
Can you feel it too?
Or maybe I'm just trippin'
I'm just really feeling you
You on a power trip, that pretty girl power shit
Got every guy falling
You'd have Superman powerless

Sometimes, yeah, it hurts but does it really matter?
I've been having dreams and it feels like wonderland
Sometimes I just wish that you would wear my sweater
But I've been holding on for too long with slippery hands

But you walk out of my life
Ooh, but I can understand you
I'm not your guy, who am I?

If I could make a wish I would get courage to tell ya
The ghost under my bed tells me don't you even try
And if I had a bird I would send a thousand letters
But I ain't got a thing 'cause you're not here by my side

But you walk out of my life
Ooh, but I can understand you
