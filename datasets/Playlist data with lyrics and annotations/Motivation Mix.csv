Disfrute todo este tiempo rapear sobre varios ritmos
En viajar sobre esos ciclos formando mi propio estilo
Mientras persegu√≠a mi sue√±o el cual pensaban que era un mito
Y deje lenguas malas mal paradas en el mal camino
Buscando entre mis letras porque el mundo esta podrido
Dos polos opuestos con una opini√≥n sobre lo escrito
Un soldado mal her√≠do, su familia a√∫n en el nido
Preocupados por eso que tanto aman caiga en el olvido
Rezen por m√≠ si no quieren de m√≠ un √∫ltimo grito
A√∫n me sobran ideas pa' sustituir mi himno
El circo de mis cr√≠as a√∫n sigue con sus actos
Siguen bajo mi ala por miedo al orfanato
La escasez les pesa y no pueden pasar el rato
Pero no puedo limpiarlos, siguen los restos en mi plato
Agradezcan que soy yo y no soy cualquier otro forro
Ese idioma es conocido, se escucha y no se los cobro
El contorno de sus temas esta libre y deja hollos
Si andan buscando pruebas, la evidencia en sus escombros
Dirty trap under, combo de rap y flow en linaje
Hay desniveles en su pista, guarda el sobreviraje
Ejecuten bien su acci√≥n para evitarse contraparte
Abstenerse el que declare si ven que uno 'e lo' m√≠o' falle
Las reglas fueron claras desde la primera parte
Fuck them, la mierda que ingieran y la que se traguen
Yo siempre estuve ah√≠ cuando no estuvo nadie
Yo siempre brinde amor cuando todos buscaban odiarme
Se muere quien te delata y vive quien te salve
Los demas buscan fama, pero lo' m√≠o' est√°n en el sample
Entrax acelerando el beat, pisandolo cual McLaren

Pronto todos nos encontraremos en el mismo lado
Nuestro gran arte hoy vive pero ser√° un simple decorado
Nuevas generaciones vienen pa'l punto final y el cambio
Como Dr. Dre dijo: ""Prepararse para no estar m√°s pegado""
Pegarse es algo lindo pero el despegarse es algo hardcore
No todo dura para siempre, eso esta de m√°s aclararlo
Es un lucha interna en la que hay que dejar molerse a palos
Pero puede haber excepciones si se hace algo extraordinario
Algunos a√∫n no pierden el toque, otros siguen de pura suerte
Yo no tengo una explicaci√≥n y supongo que otros tampoco la tienen

[???] (Inspirado en ""East Coast REMIX"" de A$AP Ferg ft. Snoop Dogg, Rick Ross, French Montana, Dave East, A$AP Rocky & Busta Rhymes)
Mis ojos no negocian con el sol
No se vos, pero yo, se que no
Asique so, dame dos, golpeo shots
Una hoe, en cuatro, en el cuarto
Quiere flow, le doy flow
She want more, she want show
Give me some, n√∫mero
Babe you know, what I'm talk
Dale beba prende y pasa que se acaba hoy

[???] (Inspirado en ""GATTI"" de JACKBOYS, Pop Smoke & Travis Scott)
Como si estuviese en el hood (Yeah)
Voy escapando de los blues
Pajaros llegan al sur, y yo con a‚Äî (Woo)
Aleja tus mentiras 'e mi cara, babe
Dime girl, ¬øcuanto hice yo por usted? (Usted)
Yo le d√≠ una chance y volteo el tape
No pretendas conmigo intentar volver (Let's roll)
Necesitas un hombre, no un ruin (Okey)
Te volv√≠ste alguien d√©bil (D√©bil), ya no puedes ni fingir
¬øC√≥mo te volviste tan vil?
Tengo otra que parte el beat (El beat)
No quiero saber m√°s de t√≠ (De t√≠)
Lo tuve que hacer por m√≠ (Por m√≠)

Oh, me cuide Dios, porque yo
No, no puedo, como voy, 2-0
Vuelvo al ruedo, al juego, again
Report, de sur a' nor (Nah-nah-nah-nah-nah)

[CUANDO ESTE EN EL CLUB] (Inspirado en ""Pray 4 Love"" de Travis Scott ft. The Weeknd)
Oh, oh, olvida ese amor
Oh, oh, no te sientas la dos
Pero t√∫ rezaras por m√≠, uh-oh
Y llorar√°s por m√≠
Cuando este en el club, oh yeah
En el club, oh yeah
En el club, uh yeah
En el, en el...

(Inspirado en ""The Catalyst"" de Linkin Park)
Mi team en posici√≥n
Sale a cazar en luna llena pa' marcar
Que tus G's no ladren
Mantengan la l√≠nea
Busquen su ruta
Ahorrense un nombre, ¬°oh!
Mi team en posici√≥n
Sale a cazar en luna llena pa' marcar
Que tus G's no ladren
Mantengan la l√≠nea
Busquen su ruta
Ahorrense un nombre, ¬°oh!

Cuando cae el atardecer
No se piensa en el amanecer
Mi team en posici√≥n
Sale a cazar en luna llena pa' marcar

Oh, deseas que vuelva el tiempo atras
Y eso se te nota en tu mirada
Si pongo mis pies en el dance floor
Lloraras por m√≠ cuando este en el club

Mis ojos, con el sol
No negocian, no se llevan
Mis ojos, con el sol
No negocian, no se llevan
Mis ojos, con el sol
No negocian, no se llevan
Mis ojos, con el sol
No negocian, no se llevan

[PUEDE SER]
Se morir√≠an por ser como yo, puede ser
Morir√≠a por su amor, puede ser
Morir√≠a ilumina'o bajo el sol, puede ser
Morir√≠a quema'o por el calor, puede ser

Puede ser que me maten dentro de un hotel
O afuera de el, like Lennon, no s√©

Puede ser que se mueran por verme quien soy
Puede ser lo que nadie jamas imagino
Quieren verme colgado con la soga en el cuello
Pero mi cara de nene de 15 va a ser el punto de inflexi√≥n (Oh yeah)
No me apuro por un boicot
La trampa no me pesa pero si ese complot
El reloj de arena en su frente
Movilizen su' fuerza a√©rea ante' que despegue
Antes de que vuele
Antes de que todo' su' fuckin' planes se alteren
Locos van y vienen, de lune' a vierne'
No les contesto, estoy encerrado en el estudio to' lo' weekends

[Verso para ""Krippy Kush (Tekay Remix)"" de Farruko & Bad Bunny ft. Tekay & Nicki Minaj]
Tekay, baby
Keep it gangsta
Juega en la zona caliente
Keep it hard, baby
Mato par de presidentes, hay confidentes
Si caen los federales, baby
Pues no lo s√©, yeah (Okey)
Voy con mis alas suicidas recorriendo la ciudad
Acelero, skrt, skrt, skrt, skrt, skrt
Entre bandos criminales
Transacciones ilegales
Muchas diablas, rostros infames
Siempre rozando los pecados capitales (Que flex)
La escuder√≠a sobre m√≠, escuadr√≥n internacional (Worldwide)
Ni√±o argento, j√≥ven lunfardo, mi argot nacional (Forreo)
Mis ojos son el cristal de todo el panorama
Tantas idas y tantas vueltas y cambie la trama (Yeah)
Mueren por ser como yo, van colgados de mi soga (Es verdad)
No voy ni tre' y medio y ya estoy siendo moda (Yeh)
Tengo blanco' loco' que me desean la muer-
Pero no le freno, skrt, skrt, skrt, skrt, skrt
(Let's roll)

[Verso para ""Ahora Dice (Real Hasta La Muerte Remix)"" de Anuel AA, J Balvin, Ozuna & √Årcangel ft. Cardi B & Offset]
Y vamo' de nuevo
Desperte con un nuevo cuero
Demonios recorren mi cuerpo
Los √°ngeles sin sue√±o ligero
Noches largas en el gueto
Para que vuelva a empezar de cero
¬øDe qu√© sirvi√≥ entonces el juego?
Si al final no hab√≠a tablero

[Estribillo para ""Ain't Nothing de Juicy J ft. Wiz Khalifa & Tekay]
Hoy por los cielos hoy se surca
Piso el Aventador que borro mis propias huellas
Algunos rappers estan bajo mi suela
Es un hecho real, duela a quien le duela
Cambio de marcha, golpeo levas
Si lo' azule' no se acercan es por que el baby es una fiera
Sin los 911 en las avenidas
Voy por la ciudad con las puertas suicidas (Butterfly doors!)

[T.K.] (Inspirado en ""Lord Pretty Flacko Jodye 2 [LPFJ2])
¬øQui√©n es el blanco con lo' diente' de oro?
Fuckin' blanco, este si es bueno con todo
Distintivo en el pecho, el ""T.K."" recto
Evapora beats mientras gana terreno
¬øDime algo que me falta?
De A en B, y de C a D
Ocupe un maldito lugar
Se que no llegu√© puntual
Me mov√≠ por la ciudad
No tengo ese tiempo que tu junta busca
Aplico acci√≥n y reacci√≥n para el business
Yo met√≠ presi√≥n, ma' de do', as√≠ me lleve el juego
Mate en un clip y pase al V.I.P
Lo' blanco' de mi lado saben que esto fue as√≠

Algunos se mueren por querer alcanzarme
Se que me quieren medir, no busquen mi l√≠nea
Hotline rap, high bars
No jugar con fire si se van a quemar
Tekay, bitches
Tekay, bitches
It's Tekay, bitches
Tekay, bitches

Nunca tuve tiempo para fake raps
Ello' buscaron soga al cuello as√≠que no hay de que hablar
Mi trap esta en la punta de la fusca para pesar
Mis negro' loco' en el prado no piensan ni frenar
Se comen lo' segundo' y lo minuto' ya se prestan
Arm√© otro palo y lo arranque en el final de la cresta
Ni su mierda ma' cara hara' que yo desaparezca
Vine pa' quedarme y pa' joder la competencia
Tu hoe', no dudo, ni uno, maldito segundo
Bozal pa' que se queden mudos
Quieren que lo que es m√≠o, sea t√°mbien suyo
Yo con to'a esa mierda no influyo
Piensan que soy malo, fuckin' rapper' vende' humo
Dice que no valgo y ca' ve' que resto, sumo
Que se adapten a mi slogan no es pa' mi un recibo
Ustede' buscan mi camino
Intentan patear el ritmo

Algunos se mueren por querer alcanzarme
Se que me quieren medir, no busquen mi l√≠nea
Hotline rap, high bars
No jugar con fire si se van a quemar
Tekay, bitches
Tekay, bitches
It's Tekay, bitches
Tekay, bitches

[GATILLERA]
Ella es una bandida que ya recorr√≠o varias pistas
Tiene precio su cabeza pero no le importa estar en lista
Una criminal de carrera, guapa modelo de alto rango
Y hagas lo que hagas ella no va a pasar el rato

Obtiene lo que busca, es as√≠ de sencilla
Tiene el cuerpo de una atleta pero la mirada de una asesina
Fr√≠a y manipuladora, mejor no frontiarla, es una fiera
Es loca y desquiciada, por algo es ""La Gatillera""

[M.A.P.A] (Inspirado en ""Blocka La Flame"" de Travis Scott)
Yo-yo-yo-yo siempre suelo derrapar, hoy voy a acelerar, ya
Voy a tatuar mi nombre en el mapa, salgo a cazar
Guerrero sin espada, orden en mi espalda
Quiero volar, yeah
Mantenerme en vuelo like 6 Mafia

Voy con gran motor, ventiun' pulgada' de grosor
Pa' la transmisi√≥n hay turbo
Los bajos no aguantan presi√≥n
Revolucione' por minuto, con todo al m√°ximo
BPM's volando, el beat entrando en vapor
Esta todo bajo control
El panorama siente el calor
Tengo par de loco' espiando bajo el cerrojo
Eso' cuervos estan viendo hacia mis ojos
Loco A$AP Ferg, traigo el trap de Dios
Busquen otro puerto que no embarcaran en el m√≠o
Navego a mar abierto, voy en busca de m√≠s r√≠os

Yo-yo-yo-yo siempre suelo derrapar, hoy voy a acelerar, ya
Voy a tatuar mi nombre en el mapa, salgo a cazar
Guerrero sin espada, orden en mi espalda
Quiero volar, yeah
Mantenerme en vuelo like 6 Mafia

Alabado sea el se√±or, dijo Rocky
Flex, flex, flex, gracias Lord
Guardo ese tiempo de dedicaci√≥n
Ya tengo mis caballos en el mar
Ahora me deslizo cual ruta polar
Suelto los cane', momento de estar
No puedo frenar, pasa el tiempo
Y es mi momento de el tiro ejecutar
Cargo, recargo, disparo, no a la nada
Sino a lo que le tengo que dar
Veo las ventanas del alma del panorama
Cuantos perros conviviendo con rabia
Pero esto es cosa de tiempo
Son cosas que se saben que son muy sabias
Tengo precisi√≥n justa pa' dar en la diana
Mi objetivo llenar lo que pueda la bodega de lana

[P.O.L.I.C.E] (Inspirado en ""Nobody's Listening"" de Linkin Park)
A la mierda la police, todas sus Glock o nueve
A la mierda la police, sus placas no nos mueven
A la mierda la police, y todas sus ordenes
A la mierda la police, ya no interceden

Su peli caduco, proteger y servir, ya nadie lo ve
Ustede' hacen de todo menos lo que deber√≠an hacer
Ese eslogan queda chico pa' una placa sucia sin nombre
Golpear y tirar de nueves demuestra ajeno desinter√©s
Sobre la vida y el derecho de to' los habitantes
Ahora uno 'e sus renos cumple condena en la carcel
Los otros tres reyes magos con cargos por involucrarse
Y un √°ngel nuevo en el cielo ahora acompa√±a a mi padre
La justicia muerde de nuevo aunque calme poco el hambre
Pero el mundo sigue firme y claro con el mensaje
Desde el lado sur del mundo seguimos el linaje
Va m√°s alla de la raza, son los mismos canales
Nuestros pueblos con el derecho de expresarse
Y todo departamento con orden de callarse

Nunca voy a olvidarme de tus iniciales en mi piel
Con mi maldito cuello exhaustado a punto de caer
Su maldita protecci√≥n solo sirve al mundo m√°s estres
Todos somos uno y bajamos por un mismo and√©n

[???] (Inspirado en ""Hella Hoes"" de A$AP Mob ft. A$AP Nast, A$AP Rocky, A$AP Ferg & A$AP Twelvyy)
Oh, tengo un cuero nuevo que me quiere dar parte superi-
Oh, ella busca un punto pero yo no tengo punto inferi-
Oh, me quiere medir, busca algo de m√≠, rastrea el click
Su mano en mi jean, quiere el switch
Cajita feliz, tu defensa va
Esta en la zona, busca horas
Ta' candente, like Arizona
Aplica y acciona, direcciona
Mete cambio, lo pisa ahora
La 10' de Marado', ella le gusta el juego
Quiere jugar con fuego, adicta al duelo
Trae par de trucos nuevos
Ella se trepo y la lleve al cielo

[???]
Tengo tanto cuero' pa' cortar al lado m√≠o que ya no le veo sentido
Rocky o Carti, pues los dos de un tiro
A$AP Ferg, trap de Dios todo mi sonido
Oh Dios explicame en que l√≠o me he metido
Par de locas me buscan anillo
Dios cuidame de eso' compromiso
Yo de esa' cara' de √°ngele' no me f√≠o
Hazles caer el disfraz as√≠ no me mido
Bendecime el arco as√≠ loco yo sigo
Tan pegado' a mi slogan y no cobro recibo
Yo de esas cosas nunca me olvido
Les molesta saber que escupo verdade' sobre el vinilo
Guapo divino
Tantas vuelta' que le d√≠ al mundo que ahora el mapa ni miro
Ya se que estoy ah√≠ por la mierda que soy y digo
El que conoce mi estadio es testigo
Sal√≠ del nido de' cr√≠o a navegar en lo' r√≠o'
A buscar lo que Dio' dejo puesto en mi camino

[BLANCO Y NEGRO]
Ello' se creen blanco' pero se sienten negros
Yo ando limpio
Vengo del sur, Ezeiza, V.G., central hood, acostumbra'o al hielo
So√±e so√±ando que alg√∫n d√≠a iba a darme el lujo de sentirme jefe
Tener a la vuelta de la esquina la envid√≠a a do' metro' de frente

[T.N.R] (Inspirado en ""No Cap"" de Future & Young Thug)
Stay 100, MarGielaa, eso es trap
Hice entrar el monopolio en quiebra
Siempre atado al pecado capital
Maldito trap and roll, it's a fact
Estoy entero
Prendido fuego
Solt√© el perro
Y me lleve el juego
Motor en combusti√≥n
Turbocompresor
Forja' la suspensi√≥n
Lo que vale mi inyecci√≥n
Peces gordos me buscan entrada
No los contesto ni hoy, pero tampoco ma√±ana
Mi vida to' un sold out dates, las fechas estan contadas
Quieren el gol de oro, pa' que se aloque la grada
Envid√©nme, a√∫n no est√°n en el radar

Fuera del negocio del trrrap
Ya lo domine, ¬øpa' qu√© m√°s?
Caras dicen ser reales y no lo muestran
Ustedes el hip-hop no representan

[???] (Inspirado en ""Hop Out"" de A$AP Twelvyy ft. A$AP Ferg)
Si lo' azule' no me ven es porque voy como un 'Rari
Llev√≥ a Europa en mis pie' con piquete de Italy
Una vida de lujos, se√±or Liberace
Y una scuderia de mujere' atr√°, soy Playboi Carti
Si lo' azule' no me ven es porque voy como un 'Rari
Llev√≥ a Europa en mis pie' con piquete de Italy
Una vida de lujos, se√±or Liberace
Y una scuderia de mujere' atr√°, soy Playboi Carti

Me calzo un par de calzado', serpiente' en mi pies
Ella rockea Channel, lleva un bolso Cartier
Voy con ma' de un caden√≥n como Slick Rick
Brillando ma' que el sol como lo e' un kingpin
Esa hoe' modelo de Paris las tiene en shock
Una chica estratega, va con plan mejor
Las dema' estan mord√≠'a, no pue'n sacarle el flow
Pero ella va bendec√≠'a, va de la mano de Dios
Es tan leal a mi sangre, como la Cardi en lo' Bloods
Siempre puesta pa' mi, no pa' lo que quieran ello'
Voy con chaleco a lo Fifty cruzando New York

[INTERNACIONAL] (Inspirado en ""Upper Echelon"" de Travis Scott ft. T.I. & 2 Chainz)
Directo del sur, cabalgo en la ciudad
Y estoy en el altar, rango internacional (Let's roll)
Estoy en el fuckin' altar, rango internacional
(Tekay, let's roll)

[PECAR Y OLVIDAR] (Inspirado en ""STOP TRYING TO BE GOD"" de Travis Scott ft. Kid Cudi, Philip Balley, James Blake)
Vuelvo en el amanecer
Yo bien sab√≠a que iba a volver
A primera hora pa' el atardecer
Salgo en busca de caer en el ayer
Desconectado de la realidad
Me dejo llevar por la versatilidad
Balances entre el bien y el mal
Midiendo calidad y cantidad
Nada de esto me va a cambiar
Soy un pecador, lo puedo aceptar
Hace tiempo me volv√≠ alguien vulgar
En cualquier momento me van a frenar
Porque nadie aqu√≠ es un santo
Nadie tiene el control sobre los mandos
No hay dos sin tres pa' lo que hay en manos
Debo proteger lo que he logrado, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Pecar y olvidar
Pecar y olvidar (Eso es lo que eres)
Pecar y olvidar (Vas contra la voluntad)

[BLACK] (Inspirado en ""Who Dat Boy"" de Tyler, The Creator ft. A$AP Rocky)
Outfit black, direcciona aqu√≠
Perras en black, diesel clean
Me piden m√°s gas, no se que hacer
Tengo die' perras detr√°s de m√≠
¬øCu√°ntas de ellas conmigo querra mentir?
Al ritmo del trap se van a venir
No van ser yo por metersela a las que se lo met√≠

Perros actuando como perras
Y perras actuando como perras
Van a hacer despertar la fiera
No quiero ver m√°s cuerpos bajo tierra

[MOTORSPORT] (Inspirado en ""Clusters"" de Big Moochie Grape)
¬øCu√°ntos se mueren por querer alcanzarme?
Van de 0 a 100 a 300 como un Roadster
Pero voy 2.0 con flow Motorsport, yeah
Mi bloque esta caro, transmisi√≥n y torque
Jugando como 10, valpuleo el deporte
Bodykit con blindaje, no roster
Les corro entero el eje, les corto el aire
Pa' frontiarme en la pista les falta agarre

Keepin' racing flex, todav√≠a tengo la llave
Copiar mis movimientos no es la clave
Cuentarevoluciones, los deje sin calle

En el game ballin', presi√≥n o chantaje
Como Kid Cudi, jugando d√≠a y noche al doble

Pa' encontrarme el truco, les falta engranaje
Caras largas se caen, ello' no ven lo que traje
Frontiar conmigo es entrar en sobreviraje

[Verso para Wow (Remix) de WE$T DUBAI]
Piquete fr√°nces, perfume Dior
Espera a su nueve, a que llegue Pogba
Me espera en la cama con taco' Chanel
Vo'a sacarla campe√≥n como el PSG

[FRESH]
Al lado tuyo ma', me siento fresh
Ahora guardo cash en el bank

[¬øQU√â VOY A HACER?] (Inspirado en ""WHAT TO DO?"" de JACKBOYS, Travis Scott & Don Toliver)
¬øC√≥mo yo llegue hasta aqu√≠?, girl
Dime s√≠, esto va' a seguir, yeah
Esta es mi manera
Y yo se que te gusta pero

A√∫n estoy roto, yeah
A√∫n estoy roto, yeah
¬øY ahora qu√© voy a hacer? (Yeah)
A√∫n estoy roto, yeah
A√∫n estoy roto, yeah
¬øY ahora qu√© voy a hacer? (Yeah)

Si me quiere' encontrar, no estoy en el Est-
Ando' negociando por el West

[UNDERGROUND] (Inspirado en ""Hood"" de Chief Keef)
Ella lo baja underground
Si lo mueve underground
Me noquea en primer round

[N√âMESIS]
Cooperando a la par con el n√©mesis
Fui el indicado pa' ejecutar el g√©nesis

[Estribillo para ""Bake Sale"" de Wiz Khalifa]
Yeah
Momento del pastel, hell yeah
La hoguera voy a encender, hell yeah
THC y purple drank, hell yeah
Nunca me sent√≠ tan bien, hell yeah
All day, hell yeah
Estamo' pa' vender, hell yeah
THC y purple drank, hell yeah
Nunca me sent√≠ tan bien, hell yeah

I picked up the phone, hell yeah, yeah, yeah
Llamadas recib√≠ y un mont√≥n, hell yeah, yeah, yeah
Me puse pa' una venta de pastel, yeah, yeah, yeah
Y ahora no paro de vender, hell yeah, yeah, yeah

[???] (Inspirado en ""GANG GANG"" de JACKBOYS & Sheck Wes)
Mucha gente se pregunta
¬øQu√© por qu√© yo eleg√≠ el trap?
√önica carta en mesa
No fue una jugada al azar
Ahora forreo en pista

[DESIGNER]
Ella manos de artesana, me enrola uno' Backwood'
Y luego guarda los blone' en su bolso Cartier
High queen class, Paco Rabanne
Ella es mi Medusa, no la mires
Se va moviendo con Versace en los pies
Como brinda luz, un piquete del primer
No todo' los hombres la pueden tener
E per le vie voglie, la zapa' Neon Gucci
Y porque no t√°mbien un Louis bell
Mama ya lo se, llevo a Europa en mis pies
Designer de primera, par de refle' y chains
Water y oro, la combi' perfect
Sombreri' Galliano, Armani fragance
Soy un mago, llevo el poder
Mucha gente a mi no me quiere ver
Tengo blanco' que me desean la muerte
Pero yo ando ocupado probandome un Philipp Plein
Oh, oh, yeah, bitch

[BIG LEAGUES]
Ballin' en grande' ligas
Llam√°n para los negocios del trap, yeah
La nueva vaina de cada d√≠a

[GAS] (Inspirado en ""???"" de Foogiano)
Ella me lo pide, yo le mando gas (Yeah)
Si ella esta dispuesta, pues le mando mas (Ah)
Oh, baby you movin' so fast, yeah

Nos movemos tan r√°pido que se corta el aire
En la fresca noche de Buenos Aires
Con sus curvas casi me descontrolo
Y casi entro en un sobreviraje

[???]
Sale a desfilar las penas
Como dijo el var√≥n
Ella mat√° con cualquiera
Quiere escribir historia en el capsul√≥n
Ella quiere que all√° testigos que la miren
Quiere sentirse importante

[???]
El plan B se fulmina, el plan A e' el que domina
Y ello' flow a√±o 2000, juegan promoci√≥n
Nosotro' disfrutando de ser las caras de la liga

[???]
Tengo par de piezas, llevemono' el set

[???]
Ella lo mueve arriba de lo' dollar' (Oh)
Pidi√≥ otra vuelta al rodeo pa' matar las horas (¬øQu√©?)
Loco buscando ese fruto que a todo loco impresiona (Ese fruto)
Cualquier loco ve esa' curva', contravolanta y direcciona
Pero mi cuerpo no reacciona (No)
Me estampo a 120, mi rostro besa la lona (¬°Hola!)
Mai', tus ojos son cristal, el espejo de to'a la zona (De la zona)
Molly, Xana' y papers verdes encima de su cola
Las drogas que a todo motor revoluciona
Ma' igual yo toco to'a tu loma
Aunque vaya con suspensi√≥n alta
Contigo me hago desparecer por un rato fuera del radar
Okey

[ESTUVE]
Ma' por tu amor olvido la gesti√≥n
Dejo lo que queda de toda mi acci√≥n
Lo gasto con vos
Arriba la mesa, el placard o el colch√≥n
Yo s√© que no soy un √°ngel, tampoco un diablo
Llevo los dos polos, te pido perd√≥n
Buscando morir aunque sea un rato
Yo s√© que otro no tiene el tacto
Que soy la mierda que soy
Que soy lo que Dios quiso
Flow kilero de negro pero soy blanco
Matemono' de una ve' ante' que salga el sol
Cargo to' lo' flow
Sweet sweetie like Jamba Juice ho'
Esta ve' no hay prensa pa'l complot (No, no)
Auto-boicot, no te atreva' a decirme que no
Si es lo que deseas me voy

Que sue√±o lucido tuve
Arriba 'e su carne estuve
Lo mov√≠a pa' mi y quer√≠a que dure
Que se quedar√° un rato ma' y no se mude
Cuando estoy con ella me calienta la sangre
Hace que muera de hambre
Que me rompa el bozal, yeah
Esa' pasti' loca mortal, yeah
No paro de so√±arte
Aunque este en rojo voy a darle
Quer√≠a su amor desde antes
Solo quer√≠a enamorarme

¬øDe esto fuckin' loco quien me va a frenar?
¬øDe esto fuckin' franco' qui√©n me va a bajar?
El fuckin' headshot no lo van a lograr
Que rajen de aca, afuera la salida
Ma' yo estoy pa' vo' y pa' nadie ma'
Fuck a cualquier blanco o negro que me quiera buscar
Muero por vo', juego por tu lealtad
Apuesto por lo que sos en realidad
Copa doble, hoy no vo'a descansar
Donde hay fuego, ma' cenizas habr√°
Asique no me vengas a contar
Seguiremo' teniendo varia' ida' y vueltas

Esto' flow' magic a ello' no le' sale
Tachalo' 'e la lista a eso' cobarde'
Ninguno demuestra lo que vales
Calentemo' la habitaci√≥n, dale
Prendamo' calef√≥n, dale
Yo muero por vos, lo sabes
El se muere por m√≠, I got it
Ac√° no hay un do', dale
Ac√° solo estoy yo, mami

Sue√±o que me muevo entre su' curva' y nos cortamo' el aire
En una noche fresca en la ciuda' 'e Buenos Aire'
Fuckin' loco que no venga a acotar, yeah
Una entrada le va a costar, yeah
Que venga con tanque lleno si me quieren ganar, yeah
Arriba 'e tu piel ya nada es igual, yeah
Me quiere arrastrar, yeah
Me va a hacer llegar, yeah
Do' loco' vulgare'
Un d√∫o ilegal, yeah
Tamo' lindo mami
Baila pa' mi, ¬øqu√©?
Yo bailo por ti, babe
Ojala sea for real, yeah
Ojala sea for real, yeah
Fuckin' for real, yeah

[???]
Mami matemono' ante' de que salga el sol
¬øSi quien nos va a ver?

[???]
¬øCuanto calor en la habitaci√≥n?
Esas sabanas sintieron el furor
Mami pregunto cuando volver a vernos

[???]
Si ese es tu combo, no lo frontees
Si esa es tu gata, no la muestres
Puede que tu combo, no vuelva al set
Pero que tu gata, quiera un replay
Que con una mirada, me la lleve
Y que otra vez, me trague la llave
Saben que voy flex, en cada mes
Voy con tanta frescura que ya no se que es
Si es el hielo, o mi flow de nigga del West

[???]
Y ahora todos dicen que cambi√© (Yeah)
Que ya no soy el mis-mo de ante' (Ah)
Que me deje afectar por la fama (Na)
Es normal que lo digan, mami, no te haga drama (-ma)
Pero ahora yo pregunto, ¬øqu√©?
¬øCu√°ntas caras de esto quieren ser parte? (Parte)
De lo que tengo y ofrezco, yeah
¬øCuanto' y cuanta' con este loco tienen gana' de acostarse? (Yeah)
Muchos estan dispuestos

[???]
Saco flows del pantal√≥n, ¬øquien me va a frenar?
Y eso truco' y skills de esa trampa y a√∫n no me pueden pistear
Jod'io blanco no frena ni aunque la curva de la muerte vaya a tomar
La dobla al 100 con o sin falta de versatilidad, unico e inigual

Que sus corbatas la usen de soga pa'l cuello que yo me pienso quedar aca

[CARDI]
Una real gangsta, jefa y bandolera
Leal a su sangre como si fuese la Cardi
Y yo con tanto' cuero' parezco Playboi Carti
La mami ni una santa, y yo ningun santo
La nena busca un pleito, esta tentando al diablo
Voy a ser que se me acueste, antes de lo pensado

[REVOLVER]
Ya tu cara indica que con otro ya no querr√°s volver
Tuviste suerte de que no te toco la bala del revolver

Ah, ¬øcu√°ntas balas te quedan en ese rev√≥lver?
Esto no es ruleta rusa, dispara haber si te haces m√°s hombre
Yo ya soy leyenda como Kurt, no necesito seguir inflando mi nombre
Puedo morirme tranquilo o que maten, no tengo ma' nada que esconder

[LA V√çUDA NEGRA]
Ella bandida, una cri-mi-nal como Griselda

[???]
Ma' hoy le rezo a la luna y salg√≥ a bailar
Entre alcohol y reggaeton me pondre a desfilar
Voy a matar lo que ten√≠a dentro hace full time
La noche hoy se presta, el tiempo ya lo indica, okey

[PAPEL ESTELAR]
Miradas inquietas, eh
Buscando obtener el papel estelar
Mi papel estelar, y algunos pidiendo que corte los r√≠os
Cuando la marea es tan alta que ya no la puedo controlar
Los miro en el altar, buscando el truco pa' poderme llegar
Se los ve mal, m√°s de lo normal
¬øCu√°ntas maniobras necesitan para poderme destronar?
Pero siempre deseando tener mi cara, mi ropa, mi flow, hasta incluso mis tracks
Mis bars, mil bars, mi freestyle, mi estilo de vida
Wachos sin planes buscando que contar
Su tiempo les pesa, lo que hacen no progresa
¬øY encima yo tengo que ser el que les brinde comida?, fuck
Se piensan que estoy pa' regalar el tiempo
Cuando tengo un cofre de oro con distintos tempos
BPM's volando y yo contento
Sus perros buenos dectectives buscando la semilla que siembro
Ya no estoy para andar cortando miembros
Estoy pa' cojerme el tiempo con o sin la velocidad del viento

[???]
Estas wachas tan locas, refleja su don
Manos de artesana, me cortan la sed
Energ√≠a en sus palmas, no hay otro flow
Enc√≠ma m√≠o quieren crear arte
¬øCuantas dando la talla peleando posici√≥n?
¬øCuantas sacando brillo a su condici√≥n?
¬øCuantas queriendo estar con el rey por auto-elecci√≥n?
¬øCuantas quieren subir su revoluci√≥n?

[???]
Ella no baja la apuesta, sube el nivel

[???]
Tengo a mis huesos y carne retorciendose, desgarrandose
Gritando al ritmo del beat, mi piel acalorandose
Vaporizandome, ma' si tengo pa' dar que
Tengo letra' que armaran historia pa'l tape

[???]
Entre nuevas situaciones, se encuentran opciones
Pa' poder cumplir nuestras nuevas tentaciones

[???]
Buscando tener la corona de un rey sin salir a romper la avenida
La hoguera saca chispa, se refleja el contorno de lo' flow
Las perras bounce su defensa como si fuese low-rider
Negro blanco due√±o del flow ardiente como Ghost Rider
Mami voy vola'o por la city y me la creo, nigga, soy Ryder
Andando en el lab como Ice Cube creando arte
Con mis hueso' y carne, jodi'os negros sali'os de Harlem
Que mis futuros haters a sus santos le rezen

[DOWNTOWN] (Inspirado en ""UPTOWN"" de Travis Scott ft. A$AP Ferg)
Fuera del downtown

[???]
Un motor tan grande llevo como si fuese un V8
El carburador cantando el himno, ma' se pone rojo
Y yo con tanto' loco' sin ideas espian detra' del cerrojo
Los voy a poner a bailar y a que armen coreo, pero igual
Hagan lo que hagan yo sigo aqu√≠ con pico y pala
Sin salir a la calle voy juntando varias manzanas
Si sigo as√≠ mi rostro puesto en la Gran Manzana
Algunos no emanan y a otro le' sobran las ganas
Esperando moverme de aca pa' alla como ruta polar
Pero mami se que ya con otro no querras volver
Todav√≠a no te ha tocado la bala puesta del revolver

[???]
Ma' el tambor no esta vac√≠o, me queda una bala
Si apreto del gatillo asesino a mas de una sala (Okey)
Tentanciones hay y se sienten en la recamara
Ahora el blanco viaja, pa' los negocios llaman
Ya no quieren saber m√°s na' de mi por no estar m√°' en la banca

[???]
Hice caer varias caras de G en el club
Tanto rango y flow pero tu crew no lo val√≠o

[???]
Su estomago d√©bil no aguanta tanto flow
¬øCu√°ntos quieren frontearme sin condici√≥n?
Ellos dicen tener motores pero van puesto todos a inyecci√≥n
¬øMami que a la par?
Si voy solo en la punta y ellos ocupado' con su transmisi√≥n
Tanta inyecta pa' la combustion, van a joder entero su bloque
No quiero quejas ni reclamo', cuando venga yo con lo' choque'
Tanto pimp, tanto pimp
Tanto aquello pero el cigue√±al se les rompe
Y yo con el monoblock entero, voy dirigiendome para el Norte
La biela sube, el pist√≥n baja
Impulso natural, voy contando nubes
Arb√≥l de lebas, m√°s de 6, no Lambo, mejor que aca no juegen
Sin intermitentes, no ven pa' donde doblo y paro
Por eso es que ya me pierden
Me deslizo polarizado, con el chasis reforzado
Ligero pero aguanto golpes, voy con suspensi√≥n al tope
Fuck el beat se rompe, mi estilo siempre dando el toque
Fuck lo' blanco' o negro' que falen lo m√≠o
Yo se que lo suyo no corresponde
Tanta critica pero cuando salto yo ya nadie responde
Ahora esa es la nueva, to's se esconden
Por mi que se muevan o que no lo crean
Que yo sigo siendo el mismo loco de lune' a vierne'
No paro ni aunque llegue roto lo' finde'
Los sabados y domingos t√°mbien queda acci√≥n para el business

[M&M's] (Inspirado en ""BUTTERFLY EFFECT"" de Travis Scott)
Por esta vida que no puedo cambiar
Chicago dreams, M&M's marcan mi piel
Ma' ¬ød√≥nde est√°s?, que te quiero ver

Muchos ladran, poco muerden
Asique que a mi que me van a decir
Quieren contar, a mi o a mi team sobre lo que tengo que hacer

Oh please, a mi, oh god
Se√±or, se√±or ponelos a entrenar
Que encuentren el truco si me quieren llegar

[ENCIENDO LOS MOTORES]
Veo locos caminando entre las paredes
Y yo rapeando como un HP todos los weekends
Les baja la presi√≥n, rompo su condici√≥n, fuck su evoluci√≥n
Mientras yo me sigo parando en el mismo escenario consiguiendo lo que otros no tienen

Ma' no tengo nada que perder
Sigo manteniendo el rango por ac√°
Pero ya no sostengo la fuerza que imponen mis caballos en el mar
El oleaje es tan alto, y tan fuerte el contacto
Que a muchos esto les puede no agradar
Las ventanas de mi alma miran pa' otro lado
No tengo m√°s tiempo que desperdiciar
Tan metaf√≥rico el loco este que ya todo no le ve tan igual
¬øCu√°nta originalidad les falta a ustedes para dejarme de buscar?
M√°s dramas que explotan, y yo con una nota tan alta
Que la fiebre me hace volar
Les duele que esto ellos no lo tengan y yo riendome
¬øDe que me puedo quejar?

Sonido hay por todos lados, siempre respetando los que dan los se√±ores
Pero ¬øqui√©n carajo se me compara cuando enciendo los motores?
Sigo firme viajando de aca pa' all√° pa' dar lo que otros no dan el doble
Algunos me envidian porque estan frustados por no llegar a est√°s revoluciones

No tengo la culpa de que no hayan nacido con la condici√≥n con la que nac√≠o este hombre
No tengo la culpa de no pensar como ustede' y estar del la'o de los ganadores
No quiero perder tiempo pensado el que diran los espectadores
Quiero perder tiempo estando ocupado pensando en como estampar por el mundo mi nombre

Otro hijo de puta como yo no va a volver a nacer

[ESTOY LOCO, LO S√â]
Ma' estoy loco, lo s√©
Navegando en lo' mare', buscando que hacer
¬øCu√°nto va a aguantar el tim√≥n?, ma' no lo s√©
Entrando en marea altas pero ya llegue a tierra firme

Ma', ya encontre lo que nos va a hacer cegar todo el tiempo
Si lo hacemo' el bobo aquel obtendra un lindo recuerdo
Hacerlo lento es la opci√≥n pa' no sentir que el time se vuela fiero
Vas a pedir la medicina que hace que veas que todo esta correcto
Bien perfecto, lo veras vos, no lo hare yo, no s√©, ma' lo siento
Somo do', √∫nicos, pa' este momento
¬øQuien mejor que nosotros ahora se estar√° mintiendo?
Ya no somo' pan y vino, pero tampoco somo' cuerpo y sangre
Somo' do' loco' divino creando una hermosa obra de arte
¬øCuanto amor pa' darme y cuanto amor yo a vos para t√°mbien darte?
Y cuanto amor pa' darle al loco ese creyendos√© el gangster

Ma' estoy loco, lo s√©
Mas loco que el, mas loco que tu ex
Mas loco que el ex de tu ex de tu ex, oh yeah
¬øCu√°ntos querr√°n ser testigos para hablar del ayer?
Vo' quere' una pieza, yo miles, bebe
Hacerlo al ritmo de este tango con lujuria y placer
Quiero que vos seas mi Isabel, yo tu Carlos Gardel
Rindamosle culto a la dama y al se√±or de este sample
Brindar sexo en cada pieza, reventar ma' de un burd√©l
Beba mi motor va a mil vueltas, el tuyo no s√©
Quiero morir en el intento, acribillado en tu piel
O sacar campe√≥n al equipo, quedando so flex
Llevandome el set

[???]
Y la bitch que no quiere frenar en el phone
Buscando aval del rey, quiere estirar el plug
Quiere tentarme otra vez, pero ese fuego caduco
Ahora busco placer, navegando en nuevos mundos

Su colmena se va a desprender, fuckin' X su adicci√≥n
Yo podr√© ser igual, but I got a limit pa' ca' situaci√≥n
La noche op√°co el sol, momento de salir en condici√≥n
Ideas bailan en mi cabeza buscando matar el tiempo

La ciudad brillando, y tus piernas temblando
Momento exacto pa' bailar un tango
Horario apto, cuerpos en contacto
Aprovechemos estas horas pa' entrar en calor

[Verso para FULL ICE (Remix) de Ysy A]
Tengo perras tirando le√±a que no cuelgan el phone
Buscan aval del rey, todas quieren del plug de oro
¬øCu√°ntas frases banales salen de su boca?
Quieren tentarme de una ve' pero al final gan√≥ yo
Su colmena se va a desprender, fuckin' X su adicci√≥n
Yo podr√© ser igual pero tengo limites pa' cada ocasi√≥n
La noche se hace larga y ella montandose por rayas de coca
¬øQu√© voy a hacer cuando pas√© el limite y entre en shock?

[HORSEPOWERS] (Inspirado en ""Nightcrawler"" de Travis Scott ft. Swae Lee & Chief Keef)
Vo'a romper otro Molly, vierte otro Molly
Cega'o por los flashes, la ciudad est√° on fire
M's como candy, llevo pecados en la sangre
Revente el blindaje, horsepowers en el lina-

La noche lla-m√°, oh yeah (Oh)
En el party todo el team en posici√≥n
Siempre drogado pero con la mejor condici√≥n
Quieres matar las penas, baja hasta el suelo
No hay quien arme, aqu√≠ no hay duelo
Vo'a romper otro Molly, vierte otro Molly
Cega'o por los flashes, la ciudad est√° on fire
M's como candy, llevo pecados en la sangre
Revente el blindaje, horsepowers en el lina-

La noche llam√°, oh-oh, yeah
La noche llam√°, oh-oh, yeah
Vo'a romper otro Molly, vierte otro Molly
Cega'o por los flashes, la ciudad est√° on fire
M's como candy, llevo pecados en la sangre
Revente el blindaje, horsepowers en el lina-

Vo'a romper otro Molly, vierte otro Molly
Cega'o por los flashes, la ciudad est√° on fire
M's como candy, llevo pecados en la sangre
Revente el blindaje, horsepowers en el lina-

Cuando la noche llam√°, me preparo pa' el airborne
Avisale al piloto que estoy listo para el vuelo
Hoy vo'a tocar el cielo, ma' la noche lla-m√°
Cuando la noche llam√°
Gasto money, lo gasto en drogas, lo gasto en alcohol
Como vampiro salgo siempre cuando baja el sol
Mami vamo' pega'o los dos, horsepowers on

Cuando la noche llam√°, me preparo pa' el airborne
Avisale al piloto que estoy listo para el vuelo
Hoy vo'a tocar el cielo, ma' la noche lla-m√°
Cuando la noche llam√°
Gasto money, lo gasto en drogas, lo gasto en alcohol
Como vampiro salgo siempre cuando baja el sol
Mami vamo' pega'o los dos, horsepowers on

¬øY ahora que van a decir de mi?
Traje lo que le faltaba a este mundo
Se que yo no soy perfecto, pero siempre enfrente cada situaci√≥n
Mami yo s√© que con todo esto me gane un lugar en el infierno
Pero estando vivo o muerto yo ya sent√≠a antes el calor
Pa'l punto final la combusti√≥n, dejen que queme, no quiero sentir fr√≠o
Fuck la mierda que eso' blanco' digan, se que no tienen raz√≥n
Sigan buscando con que quemarme que sigo siendo el punto de atracci√≥n
Que mientras ustedes en pico y pala, yo con wachas malas instalados en el avi√≥n
Ahora que vine, lo hice, y lo tire, to's giran todos para est√° direcci√≥n
Soy el perfecto wacho loco que vino a poner el juego en evoluci√≥n
Siempre haciendo algo normal y termin√≥ en el centro de atenci√≥n
Se que esta cara a muchos les pesa, llevo una scuderia en mi pantal√≥n

Necesito m√°s money
Necesito m√°s horsepowers
Necesito m√°s money
Necesito m√°s bitches
Necesito m√°s models
Necesito m√°s ragers
Y la necesito a ella

[IGNICI√ìN] (Inspirado en ""Antidote"" de Travis Scott)
Negro encerrate en tu pieza o estudio y rapea, no pares, no pares
Buscalo, encontralo, desealo por vos
Haz que tu cuerpo entre en combusti√≥n
Mareas altas en todo el mundo
Llamame loco pero esto d√≠o fruto
Los que me conocen saben que no lo dudo
Otro d√≠a m√°s en el cual no lo juro
Pero me estoy quedando yo sin suerte
Mami yo sigo rozando a la muerte
Ya no hay punto fuerte, beba no me sueltes
Tengo miedo de que esta mierda se frene
Siempre fui con mente de ganador
Pero s√© muy bien que no soy el mejor
Nunca tuve la oportunidad para pensar
Como un perdedor, como dijo Ysy A

[GOLEANDO EN EL TRAP] (Inspirado en ""Hablarme de Trap"" de OSX Mob)
Desde mitad de cancha, goleando en el trap
Mientra' ellos en el ar√©a queriendo coronar
Tantos disparos y ninguno me da
Algunos al travesa√±o pero erran igual
Como 10 en cada ar√©a, ¬øquien me va a parar?
Sobra'o de flow, saco a tu crew a pasear
Pa'l tiro libre, tengo el tiro especial
Balon con efecto, la comba mortal
Pero saben que no lo hago
Podriar soltar skills como un mago
Queriendo evadirme ellos buscan atajos
Pero es imposible, quedan regalados

[EL SOL] (Inspirado en ""3500"" de Travis Scott ft. Future & 2 Chainz)
Veamono' cuando caiga el sol
Vea-vea-veamono' cuando caiga el sol

Salgo sin la luz de sol, las calles vac√≠as
Buscando los dos, llenar el amor, de esta alcanc√≠a
Tengo miedo de quedar solo, y perdido en la aven√≠da

[AVENTADOR] (Inspirado en ""Give No Fxk"" de Migos ft. Young Thug & Travis Scott)
Voy a toda marcha, gaste metro 'e cancha como si fuese Aventador
Ya no tengo idea de a cuanta' revolucione' esta llendo mi motor
Culpa 'e la Molly es que voy muy r√°pido por todo ar√©a metro
Tu endiabla' mirada, y yo sin cara 'e nada, queriendo cegar el reloj

We don't give no fuck
We don't give no fuck
We don't give no fuck
We don't give no fuck
Fuera del mainstream
Golpeando en la street
Fuera del mainstream
Golpeando en la street
Tengo tanto hielo en el cuello que me congelo (Ice)
Despegamo' del suelo, estamo' en vuelo (No)
En rango internacional, no pueden dar duelo
La aleje de los problemas y la lleve al cielo

Hit it, yeah, wait
Play with
Quieren robar mi flow
No pueden
No lo tienen
Van y vienen
Que se alteren
¬øQu√© e' lo que quieren?

[SOLO NEGOCIOS] (Inspirado en ""NO BYSTANDERS"" de Travis Scott ft. Juice WRLD & Sheck Wes)
A pesar de que no sea fuerte
Siempre voy dispuesto aunque no lo lo-gr√©
Una mano dura, sin na' de suerte
Negocian-do con la muerte

M√°s de tres horas en este viaje
Ma' otro como yo no tiene estos planes
Dile al piloto que direccione
Y hagamos lo que se supone, que hay que hacer

Solo negocios
Solo negocios (Oh yeah)
Solo negocios
Solo negocios (Oh yeah)

Solo negocios
Solo negocios
Solo negocios
Solo negocios (Oh yeah)

A pesar de que no sea fuerte
Siempre voy dispuesto aunque no lo lo-gr√©
Una mano dura, sin na' de suerte
Negocian-do con la muerte

Hombre de negocios so flex, piden que baje el nivel
Que se jodan si no conducen el mismo carriel
Ella loca con los Xans, si rompe su colmena no va a volver
Maldito job del weekend, siempre lo hago tan bien
Tanto sexo al negocio, revente un burdel
Fuck sus reglas, yo hice las m√≠as
Voy con un motor all incluse
Ma' tan linda, pa' tene' al diablo entre tu' pierna'
Si bajas uno mas, ya no creo que vuelvas
Tom√≥ 1/4 de tu alma, de a poco vas bajo tierra
Pa'l negocio no estas, el diablo juega y no baja
No ready pa'l jaquemate asique miedo sobra
Encerra'os viviendo un thriller real

M√°s de tres horas en este viaje
Ma' otro como yo no tiene estos planes
Dile al piloto que direccione
Y hagamos lo que se supone, que hay que hacer

Solo negocios
Solo negocios (Oh yeah)
Solo negocios
Solo negocios (Oh yeah)

Solo negocios
Solo negocios
Solo negocios
Solo negocios (Oh yeah)

Baje del set, tumbe los hoteles
Papeles y l√°piz en tablet
Contador quemandose hasta los pies
Manager moviendose por dates
Otro fuckin' show, que este loco va a romper
Maldito fuckin' blanco ¬øqui√©n lo va a detener?
No hay descanso pa' un rey, fuckin' bandido sin ley
No vine pa' ser virrey, crack del poker game
Hay equipo pa'l tape, la historia en mis pies
Fuckin' Young La Flame (Trav)

M√°s de tres horas en este viaje
Ma' otro como yo no tiene estos planes
Dile al piloto que direccione
Y hagamos lo que se supone, que hay que hacer

Solo negocios
Solo negocios (Oh yeah)
Solo negocios
Solo negocios (Oh yeah)

Solo negocios
Solo negocios
Solo negocios
Solo negocios (Oh yeah)

Pero soy Tarz√°n, que t√∫ le√≥n no se duerma
Si tanto boquea, que pelee por tu selva
Uno va a terminar muerto, y otro en celda
Pero es perdida de tiempo todo este problema
Si al final yo termin√≥ quemando to' el dilema

[DELOREAN] (Inspirado en ""Drip Too Hard"" de Lil Baby & Gunna)
Ella freaky con mis games, sabe que soy su √∫nico rey
Voy por la city in flames, sin seguir el orden de la ley
Las calles vac√≠as, y yo en la cera congelandome
Que entrada en calor cuando te escucho hablandome

No siento el fr√≠o de la ciudad, debe ser culpa del ice
Marty McFly, cargado el DeLorean
Matemos el tiempo en busca de que hacer

Ma' yo se que ya tu' beso' no queman
Pero pego el oido al phone si me surgen problemas
Si t√∫ no te encuentras, cortar√© de otra manera
Con un Xanax o un 512 a la hora 'e la cena

[???] (Inspirado en ""Yes Indeed"" de Lil Baby & Drake)
Fuckin' rappers de cuarta solitos se mienten
La zona esta roja, que ellos aca no jueguen
Voy con la condici√≥n, mejor que aceleren
Si en mi limbo ustede' entran, aca ya se pierden
¬øCu√°ntos materiales cargando en el cuello?
La clave al √°ngulo y sin firmar un sello
Distinto al resto, nunca fu√≠ como ellos
Matar√≥n su respeto y buscan suero' ajeno'
¬øCu√°nta soberbia les come to' el cuero?
¬øY cu√°ntos como yo que siguen siendo buenos?
Pega'o sin disquera, sin mamar huevo a nadie
Mi sonido recorre ahora Buenos Aires
Corona'o en el sur, respeta'o como gangster
El exterior me aclama, pide mas de mi baile
Ahora to' son vampiros, chupan de mi sangre
Social crew 'e cobardes, abandonan su aire
Busquen otro puerto pa' estirar sus cables
Aqu√≠ ya no hay negocio, nos fuimo' de los mares

[D√öO ILEGAL] (Inspirado en ""Where U From"" de Travis Scott & Quavo)
Somo do' locos adue√±a'o, del frecuente peca'o capital
Do' bandido' contra el sistema, somo' el prefecto d√∫o ilegal
El estado ya no 'e capaz, de poder frenar lo que es real
Siempre evadiendo lo que es legal
¬øDe est√° mierda quien no va a sacar?

[FLORES & EQUIS] (Inspirado en ""Green & Purple"" de Travis Scott ft. Playboi Carti)
La mami es real, ella tan real
Que ella mato a un superstar
Bite, ella es psychic
Perfect timing, she is excited
Crazy body, sexy booty
Latin Cardi, Offset latin
Ma' so clean, pop a bean
Time to live, lick on me
Drive over me, vibes on me
I feel the heat, vamo' a mentir
Es una G, mami quiero volar
Vayamos too fast
¬øDime que hare con tu mirada?

Mientras tu lo mueva', el mundo sera nuestro
Sin importar lo que, lo que diga el resto
Si es controversial, como nos movemos
Si lo s√©, lo siento, movamonos m√°s lento
Movamono' m√°' len-
Movamono' m√°' len-

Me haces mal a m√≠, yeah
Pero te hago mal a t√≠, yeah
Babe, ride with me
Yeah, fuck up on me
Va-mo-no' de aqu√≠, yeah
Babe, silence here
Yeah, traje flore' y equis
Con-duzco sin la key
Mami voy sin gana' 'e quere' vivir
Dame la receta pa' ser feliz
Muero por tu cuerpo, me mata tu flow
Ya no se ni quien soy, ni a donde voy
Dime c√≥mo paro 'e poder su-frir
Llevo cinco d√≠as sin poder dor-mir
No se ni que d√≠a es hoy, ni a qu√© hora sale el sol
Matemos el tiempo, hag√°moslo slow
M√∫evelo ma', lowride' swing
Si morena, you got this
Yes you got, you got it
Que no haya un final, que sea timeless
Ceguemos el reloj, el tiempo
Golpe√© otro X pa'l momento
Matemo' de una ve' lo de adentro, yeah
Abr√≥ los puertos, que te sueltes
Loba sin piedad, sangre caliente
Sobresale de verdad, es un duelo a muerte
Eso' beso' gusto a miel, y yo sin na' 'e suerte
Me va a dejar como Cobain

Mientras tu lo mueva', el mundo sera nuestro
Sin importar lo que, lo que diga el resto
Si es controversial, como nos movemos
Si lo s√©, lo siento, movamonos m√°s lento
Movamono' m√°' len-
Movamono' m√°' len-
¬°Playboi!

Mami por t√≠ golpe√© otro Perc
Se jod√≠'o otro show, maldito fuckin' blanco con flow
Equipo entero en el spot, aprovechemo' y vamonos
Traigo pa' tus ojos tentaci√≥n, soy el guacho con mejor condici√≥n
No perdamo' el tiempo y perdamonos

[???]
Mami, vamonos
Tengo la sangre caliente
Calentemo' el ambiente
Sabes con el ya no vas a volver

[TESTAROSSA] (Inspirado en ""Yeah Yeah"" de Young Thug ft. Travis Scott)
Bajo el efecto mariposa
A la velocidad de un Testarossa
Eso' testigo hablan y son poca cosa
No van a descifrar lo dicho y hecho en prosa
Lo nuestro cosa del pasado, y ellos hablandolo ahora
Se ve que les sobra el horario
Quieren limpiarme como un Zonda

Okay babe, let's roll now, let's get out, night road
Where now, girl?, you don't know?, I'm thinkin, I know
Let's bump girl, let's go now, like my sound, you know
If you show, your big ass, my T-shirt, on ground
Ride on me, like lowride', do it girl, play slow
She poppin', a Xan now, I'm lost now, and she too
Two crows now, on the moon, doing it, who cares?
I'm drive now, too much fast, Molly have, the fault
I'm fucked up, I'm dope now, my head will, explode
I lost time, too my mind, party's off, go home

Okay babe, a rodar, afuera, rock and roll
¬øY ahora qu√©?, ¬øcu√°l e' el plan?, un puzzle, she thug
Hagamos, par de olas, 808, you know
Mi chula, tu lowride', suspensi√≥n, get low
Su cuerpo, mi cena, en la mesa hay, gesti√≥n
Papeles, un boligra', contador, g-point
Ciclog√©nesis, pintura, un lienzo, arte
Ma ¬ød√≥nde?, ¬øt√∫ quieres?, ¬ølas perlas?, dime
¬øEn la boca?, par de grillz, ¬øel cuello?, un collar
Tsunami, surfea ma', squirt girl, oh god
¬øY ese olor?, pecador, un Xanax, I'm lost
Flotando, volando, viajando, butterfly doors

But if you want it, call me
The bed will be are prepare it
In the hood or in the city
Takin' a punch of this
Yeah, yeah

Siempre mantuve el rango, fu√≠ con actitud
Ellos quisieron frontear con poca altitud
Mami, ¬ødime si me falt√≥ a m√≠ gratitud?
Todo' lloran cuando le hablan sobre la virtud
Ustede' con el pie izquierdo hacia el ata√∫d
Yo con el pie derecho hac√≠a la multitud
Hice rejuvenecer a to'a la juventud
Esta mierda habla sola sobre magnitud
Sus rostros ca√≠dos al ver como gano aptitud
Al ver como voy sobra'o de mucha latitud

[ONE MORE] (Inspirado en ""5 Mo"" de French Montana ft. Travis Scott & Lil Durk)
One more, I need one more
Una pill ma' pa'l tour, to' esto me tiene bajo presi√≥n
Pa' ti mis ojos son LED, dime en mi que puedes ver
Que es lo que quiere' ser, te lo vo'a condecer

[1-8-0-4] (Inspirado en ""5 Mo"" de French Montana ft. Travis Scott & Lil Durk)

Llamada al plug
Lo buscan, o se lo llevan, hay dos modos
Hay to' por haber, dime que quieren ser
Que quieren tener, se lo vo'a conceder

1, 8, 0, 4
Llamada al plug, lo buscan, lo tienen, lo lle-va-mos
Hay to' por haber, dime que quieren ser
Que quieren tener, se lo vo'a conceder

Mis negros con bandanas
Parecen salidos de Atlanta

[SCUDERIA] (Inspirado en ""RaRa"" de Travis Scott ft. Lil Uzi Vert, ""STARGAZING"" de Travis Scott & ""SICKO MODE"" de Travis Scott ft. Drake & Swae Lee)
Voy por la ciuda', la scuderia va so-bre mi
Rari-Rari like Ferrari, goin' crazy
Molly o Code, en el party no lazy
Revolucione' m√°xima, my mind so lazy

Toda la copa rosa, cerca a un Ferrari (Yeah)
Ma' mintamono' m√°s, vamos a Paris (Paris)
Que se joda el avi√≥n, nos sacamo' el Italy (Oh, yeah)
I have so much of this, esto nos sale gratis (Yeah, yeah)
Voy como Ferrari, acompa√±a'o 'e mis demons
Que no se corte el flow, tira m√°s de estos
Give me gas nena, abreme los puertos
Mami tengo alas, volemos recto (Yeah)
Ferrari so fast, ya no pue'o frenar, eh
Resguardame ma', que voy a chocar, yeah

Como Fangio, voy r√°pido
El maestro, genio en esto, yeah

Mami peguemo' otro viaje, otro rodeo al tour

[JETSKI] (Inspirado en ""Saint Laurent Mask"" de Travis Scott & Quavo)
Tanto agua en hielo, voy en jetski
Me deslizo por todo ar√©a metro
Sneak flash, neon Gucci
Corro maratone' como Kimetto

El brillo 'e la' Flashtrek que me cegan
No se ni pa' donde estoy llendo
Su' beso' en mi cuello ya no queman
Voy rodea'o de ice, bajo cero

[REFLEX] (Inspirado en ""Smell of Money"" de Travis Scott & Quavo)
Ice cold, el cuello froze
Water lord, Po-sei-d√≥n
Sub-Zero, voy bajo cero
Cobro cache' de lo' clube' por cada maldito show
Y ellos andan buscan' que corte to' lo' flow'
No creo que de esta mierda salga ileso
Voy tumba'o por cul-pa 'e su' besos
Ella too high, yo butterfly, somos dos
¬øC√≥mo √©s?, oh ¬øc√≥mo es?
Que me mantega as√≠ de flex
Culpa 'el reflex, yeah
Brillo en m√≠, refle' bailan sobre m√≠
Que no se corte el feel, vierte un cuarto m√°s de Lean
Y to' lo que hice, ahora que ya lo logr√©
Ahora lo corrigen, ¬øcu√°ndo, qui√©n y d√≥nde?, ja
Me he convert√≠'o en designer
Y voy con una cara que no da raz√≥n
Entiendo to' aunque vuele alto
Siempre voy bajo un efecto

Voy con reflex, bai-lan mis chains
Gua-po y flex, do-mino el set

[MAMICHULA] (Inspirado en ""Mamacita"" de Travis Scott ft. Rich Homie Quan & Young Thug)
El anterior d√≠a en el tour de Tonight
Me quede en la parte de atr√°s, en punto coma, fuck up
Intoxicado, casi voy al m√°s alla
Una vez que me vaya, ya no hay vuelta atr√°s, atr√°s, atr√°s
Mami chula, chula, muy chula
Sabes que te necesito ya, muy ya, muy ya, right now
Ella se enciende cuando las luces se apagan
Baje otro M pa' cortar las dudas
Chica fina y con estilo, como tu no hay otra
Forastera del pueblo, la bandida del lugar
Parece pornstar, big booty
Grandes pechos, pussy juicy
Dime que esto no es un sue√±o
Que esta baby no es de enserio
I will hit your ass, bitch

Si fuera la alguacil del pueblo, que me lleve a prisi√≥n
Bandida con garra, es feroz
Se que sos mala pero escondes amor
No te voy a dejar ir
Esta noche nos vamos a mentir
Quiero que me mientas una ve' ma'
La movie en play, hagamosla realidad
Motor a combusti√≥n
Mami, ¬øsientes la inyecci√≥n?
Pa' que cojerme a Am√©rica
Si con ella me cojo el mundo
Su culo anestesiado, completamente cegado
Ma' ya perd√≠ el horario

Somo' do' locos encerrados en el frecuente pecado capital
Pediste otra vuelta al rodeo asique hoy lo vamo' a incendiar
Vos y yo contra lo opuesto a lo bueno, somo' un d√∫o ilegal
La ley nos busca, a punta de fusca por evadir lo que es legal
Ma' ¬øporque lo mueves as√≠, acaso estas loca?
A cuantas revoluciones debo llegar pa' comerte la boca
Se que te gusta lo fr√≠o, tu boca se disloca
Voy a dejar mi nombre marcado en tu cuerpo ahora
Ma' ahora dime en que condici√≥n seguir
Ya no se porque sigo aqu√≠
Enterrado bajo metros, puesto pa' otro deal
Fatality, uh, brutality, uh
Quitality, Mortal Kombat, the trilogy

[CABALLOS DE FUERZA] (Inspirado en ""Skyfall"" de Travis Scott ft. Young Thug)
Sin caballos de fuerza
Voy arrastrandome por la carretera
Con un hambre que me pesa
Y con mi cuerpo pega'o a la acera
Dime mami por mi quien ya reza
Ya perd√≠ la carrera, me encuentro fuera del sistema
Yo no veo ese lema
La mentira te sal√≠o cara pero a m√≠ me quema
Me tiemblan las piernas
Pero con la frente en alto a pesar que me duela
Dilemas, problemas, ¬øpor qu√©?

No quiero llorar, no m√°s
Solo quiero volar, mucho m√°s
Abro mis ala', a to' gas
Sin importarme na', de na'

[SOLA] (Inspirado en ""Verte"" de Neo Pistea ft. Quan The Young)
No vo'a dejar que ese bobo otra ve' te deje sola
Te invito a mi cama pa' matar las horas
Montados en la ola, tengo par de rolas
Sintamo' la envid√≠a del que nos piensa ahora

Hay locura en tu boca, explaya tu forma
Si esto se va de manos no habr√° reforma
Quiero comerte toda, quitat√© todo
Mi mano en tu torax, sube hasta el torso
Tu luna de miel, la empezamo' hace poco
Se te eriza la piel, prefieres a este loco
Pa' esto soy sencillo, no quiero detalles
Si el otro ac√° pisa, mejor que no hable
Que importa si se alarda, lo veo m√°s tarde
Estoy ocupa'o contigo, cortandono' el aire

[???]
Un diamante en bruto queriendo explorar el mundo
Si no la pego con esto que sera de mi en los pr√≥ximos minutos
Algunos quieren que me calle pero lamentablemente no soy mudo
Se me da hablar y escupir realidad as√≠ de crudo
As√≠ soy yo, es como soy, naci con flow, obvio que no lo dudo

[???]
Esto suena rap pero en trap es en cual lo escupo
Porque como dije anteriormente el rap llego a su punto
Se acabaron los 90', llego el nuevo brillo del futuro
Y no venga a decir que no brilla si ya brilla a lo bruto
Cada palo semanal se graba y se queda bajo el t√≠tulo
Nac√≠ con una carga de flow que hasta ya parezco un mulo
Saben que lo hago a punto caramelo sin disimulo
Soy un diamante en bruto, lo digo para justificar mis versos
No lo digo por ser agrandado, no me va el ser canchero
Solo forreo cuando tengo que rapear y destacar mas de lo normal
Ahora no me puedo ocultar, tengo una meta que alcanzar
Un criminal m√°s que trae m√°s delitos m√°s graves para el trap
Otro m√°s de mi generaci√≥n que ejerce fuerza en contra de la autoridad
Aca muchos tienen huevos para reprochar pero no pa' hacernos cambiar
Distinta mentalidad, obvio que no somo' igual
Yo pienso en avanzar, otros solo' en quedar atras

Me dicen que frene porque no llegan a estas revoluciones
Soy el √∫nico apto para manejar en estas condiciones

Les habla Tekay, un criminal en actividad
Demostrando habilidad, cometiendo delitos con verstalidad
Yo se que a ellos no les sale igual, por eso me quieren bajar
¬øPero porque me tendr√≠a que dejar?, voy en despegue directo a volar

[???]
Andando por la city perdido, con el coraz√≥n mal herido
Hasta que no cumpla los sue√±os que he vivido
Yo no podria descansar perfectamente en paz

[???]
Porque por m√°s que tenga competencia mi sonido
Soy un diamante en bruto y lo muestro en el vinilo
Deber√≠a distinguirme a punto caramelo en cada ritmo
Pero lamentablemente triunfa el que menos da

[???]
El talento se pierde en las sombras
Se extinguen valores y obras
La mentalidad y las ideas ya no se negocian
Y a los que menos talento tienen los otros les da los huevos de nuevo pa' renegociar

[???]
Tengo una plaga, que se desplaga, por las pradas de mis sue√±os
No existen domadores que puedan domar todo este ingenio
No existen cortadores que puedan cortar todo mi sue√±o
No tengo un demonio interno que me diga cual es para mi el mejor cuero
Yo se a donde llevo mi juego, si esta ac√° es por algo negro
Porque nadie me va a decir a mi cual es el mejor precio
Yo no soy alguien necio, no me voy a vender por dos miseros pesos
Me la suda el poder, yo solo quiero dejar un legado con esto
Ser alguien diferente y poder resaltar grande del resto
Sigan tirando mierda que no me afecta ni un 1/4 de sus textos
Porque se que tengo talento y se muy bien como hacerlo

I said what's up homie? Welcome to your own lobotomy
You may have sent Dirtbag Dan back to local comedy but ain't no one stopping me
We're at World Domination 6, right? The whole globe is watching me
Ain't that about a bitch? Like a Rone biography
I said my dude, I'm honestly happy for you
I thought you'd never be the champ son
Shit, we six bars into this title match and it's already better than the last one
I mean I'm way too advanced son, I can do shit that you've never did
That's why I gotta take his last breath before he get a second wind
I mean I heard you was gonna get personal with me, I must've got in his head
Y'all been begging for a king but instead you got a God in the flesh
You want your style...your style? Is as obvious as it gets
You rap like how bitches baby-talk to their pets
Like, ""Oh, you gon' rap like this you think you‚Äôve got it handled
Oh. You gon' talk to Daniel like a cocker spaniel ARF!
Boy I catch you slipping on yo' campus while you flannel
Boy I gotta chopper knock you our your socks and sandals!""
Bitch so don't panic, your punches do no damage
I'll elbow turn your nose into nothing but bone fragments
Body blows, give him a bleeding heart like a hopeless romantic
I'm nomadic, I leave Earth with no hope of going home to my own planet
You my bro Adam, but that don't mean I won't go at him
Throw blows at him, bury him up to his throat and throw stones at him
You get cold feet? I toe tag you
You know that chrome Magnum
But that forehead cro magnon
My bullets hit you ricochet and hit Gully and Organik
I said they keep calling you a king but I think this king needs the boot
I mean honestly this whole chain needs a control+alt+delete and reboot
This guy called me a fucking ""weed"" man, but I think we can see the truth
I think he's just jealous of the weeds, at least weeds has some roots
I mean my dude, you dressed up like fucking Abraham Lincoln trying to gain some views
And then you rapped about freeing slaves while all the black people tried to escape the room
The craziest shit is
Out of all the angles this lame could use
It's funny you dress like Abe Lincoln but you're the one getting the chain removed
I'm way too smooth, you ain't never been great
Let's face facts Adam I'm already a legend today
But I swear to God the only thing black in your house is electrical tape
He probably calls the cops on his own shadow like, ""Stop him, he's getting away.""
You're a fucking faggot with no stripes
You wanna gamble but no dice
This fool Adam is so white he won't even reach in his bars
He's had everything handed to him his whole life
I said, he'll out write me and then out white me
You don't want to mess with dude
He's never struggled a day in his life, his parents put him on a pedestal
He's got a top five but no non-white rappers
He's got a tattoo right above his champ stamp that says #AllLivesMatter
He loves chai tea, tai chi
He hates Spike Lee, doing The Right Thing
He loves Skyping, typing, hiking, biking
Third Reiching, evidence hiding, stereotyping, racial profiling
Pretty much any white thing
Homie...you ain't anything like me
You ain't prepped for survival
Cause a year from now, nobody's gonna remember when you went viral
You may have cheated death before with Illmac' but now your destination is final
We can all judge this book by this cover cause the story ends with the title

[Round 1: Rone]
Roney Bae the King, formerly the prince
I call him ""cocker spaniel"" cause he's always been my bitch
Oh, so you're the super villain career ender
Well I dig that
I heard you even ended a marriage before, well that's a sick stat
But my rhymes change lives too, you doubt my impact?
Have you seen Big T lately? He's 170 with a six pack
World Domination
What? I gotta break him down geographically?
I mean Taiwan fucks with me
I guess I got that Taipei personality
I mean chicas want my Calvin's off
No strap to get my style across
Cause I rap like I got an Eagle that's the size of an albatross
I was whipping the drop Regal that's blacker than Don Cheadle
You're pall bearer, the jaw ring gon' say ""shells these are not Beatles""
Do you like your pops leave you
Horror script and the plots evil
And I already killed you once, my stories all got sequels
I'll run up on him like the Rocky steps
Slash him with a hockey stick
I killed him once, I gotta kill him again like he's a zombie flick
But there's no skeletons in my closet so this ain't another body
You're only as good as the dirt you have and you have nothing on me
I mean, I didn't cheat on my girl, not a whore in my house
But not because I have morals, let me just dispel that lie now
And not because of love, let me shoot that right down
I didn't cheat cause I was scared fucking Caustic would find out
Fucking Sherlock Holmes
He bides his time, thinking he's kinda sly
Stealing receipts, checking what I would buy like some kind of private eye
But I got hip to the game quicker, we're not painting the same picture
'kay wigger? There's a difference between a dirt digger and a grave digger
See, you're finished
Well...done, stick a fork him
The mortician, the 28.4 liter Ford engine
The unicorn, I'm Porzi≈Üƒ£is in the form with it
I'm Ben Simmons on the floor spinning
A centaur while he's formed shifting but Caustic is just
Light and projection, it's pure physics
You had the same hair-beard combo as every pussy at Coachella
So you can not be hard, it's a simple little fact
Plus you have the same voice as the pig from Toy Story
So it's only right I dump that nickel in his back!
Yo, I'll hit your niece with the braces
Get her tea bagged 'til her teeth snag, I'm her new dentist
You fuck with Juventus I use your team flag as a skeet rag
I'll let the team shag
I could get half of your family tree bag
Your baby mom is 43, does speed and let's her jeans sag
Your baby mom looks like a drag queen, I'll get your queen dragged
Rip his beard off, do his Adam's apple like a speed bag
I don't care if Soul's punch was softer than a fucking bean bag
You got slapped and just stood there just like that shit was freeze tag
I mean, damn, Daniel!
I bet that pussy wet as dam Daniel
That pussy got man handled
He hit it then kick it out he told to go pan handle
Watch me grand stand you
{punching sounds} Van Damme you
{punching sounds} Damn Daniel you don't understand I'm snuffing your man's candle
Watch me back stab you, over and over again like the needle gone on a back tattoo
Check, check, Martin Havlat you
Fold him, zip him, knapsack you
Style on him, Rat Pack you
Whip my phone out, fucking battle and beat him then fucking Snapchat you
But wait, wait, wait, wait
Maybe, keeping it all rappity rap is keeping it too basic
So if I acted how you act, well, how would you take it?
Cause if I was you, I would probably name your girl and call her a hot mess
If I was you, I would take your statements out of context
If I was you, I'd go low and come at your pops next
If I was you, I'd probably blame you for Cadalack Ron's death
I mean, getting high, getting high - Listen to me Caustic! Listen to me Caustic!
Getting high in front of a recovery addict, why would he need that?
I can't believe that
So if I was you, I would probably blame you for his relapse
But I'm not you
I'm not you
I just know my friend would like to hear his name dropped
And I miss him
You miss him too?
Well I'ma put you in the same spot
Rest in peace, that's one

[Round 2: Caustic]
Ooh, he's gonna get personal with me
Oh gee golly wiz, I can't wait
Why don't you go drink some fucking bleach since you think being white's that great
You used to be my right hand man, now you don't deserve my handshake
Game Of Thrones shit, still the King Slayer even though my right hand fake
I said I wish a motherfucker would, I be chopping 'em down
Blocks will come out, I be making Mr. Booblaka Chilaka Boo sounds
When it comes to rapping bitch I've been snapping longer than locker room towels
I'll have you stretched on a table with the doctors around
Just to tell you you ass out like a hospital gown
Oh...so I was walking around thinking like, ""Dude
What would make Adam just madder than hell?
What would take all the wind outta his sails.""
Then he said, ""Well we should mention our girls names.""
Well, don't you date that bitch Allison Dale?
Yeah? Why don't you pass the message to that slut and tell her I can excel in every way that Adam has failed
If you look at her pictures, her eyes are sad you can tell
She's so used to having two hands grabbing her tail
And get her asshole impaled by more African males than a crack addict in jail
And that's hard...
You know, that's a hard thing to live up to
But he makes up for it with a strong back rub and a solid ""I love you""
He be kissing that bitch on the mouth like it's the love of his life
But deep down he knows he just ain't fucking her right
She's got the Black Snake Moan, she likes a little mud in her pipes
I don't even know why she fucks this guy
He's all types of bitch, he's got red lips and rosy cheeks
Who the fuck you supposed to be? Tyler Swift?
You fucking giant vagina lip
I don't get what part you're not understanding
I don't know any other man in the world that could've called to have a mirror match with a tranny
I mean this is the difference between us
Y'all looking at a glimpse of a genius
But with all these pussy ass feminine little physical features
We all agree, there's No Shame if you decide to get rid of your penis
Well hold on, I got a question
How come every time somebody mentions a time Rone got molested
His face immediately looks like he just got a Botox injection?
Now, it's my chance to get him so, I better get him
I mean, fans love to tell you what you can and can't talk about but you know me, I never listen
They said ""It's an automatic loss if you talk about Sandusky or any of his alleged victims.""
Well as far as I'm concerned if you getting defensive about getting molested then you probably got fucking molested with 'em
Now I know talking about Sandusky is played but y'all know I got a little something to say
To be honest Adam, I've studied your case
And I'm not saying that being molested makes somebody gay
But...you were on the track team
At any point did you consider just...running away?
Is that not something you would try?
I mean all those years of learning how to take a baton from behind
It's like you learned nothing from the guy
I mean maybe that's why your little album Committed was trash
You haven't dealt with all that shit from your past
Maybe all those Sandusky dicks in your ass changed your pitch when you rap
All those sexual assaults and you never did nothing back?
You got raped by your running coach, no wonder you sound like such a bitch on your tracks
See I like saying shit like that just to watch him get rattled
But if you wanna see some really weird shit, why don't you check out his Complement Battle?
Now, the second I turned it on I knew there was something fucking strange going down out here
But it did answer a long time question
Who's dick do you gotta suck to get a title shot around here?
And then you think and it's just you know, it's just Adam and Patrick
They're always coming up with the wackiest antics
You know, running around Canada, acting like faggots
But that's the part that makes me think somebody really raped you
Maybe you overplay the gay thing to cover up how uncomfortable it actually makes you
So while you were out there pretending to be a couple gay dudes
How about the fact that for all that gay shit you did, Pat never actually paid you?
Aw, this shit just got incredibly real
Aye, he done sucked a dude's dick and didn't even keep up his end of the deal
Adam calling every day and Pat's like, ""Don't worry Adam, you getting it still.""
And then you took him out to dinner in L.A. and you got fucking left with the bill
That's amazing, my dude Pat, screwed you for two stacks
And you didn't do shit bitch, what part of Philly did they do that?
I mean and I don't blame him, look at Pat, he'd fucking whoop his ass
He wasn't trying to scuffle but he played it like it was an accident but you actually kind of got hustled
I bet you was having Sandusky flashbacks yelling at Pat like, ""Why did I trust you?!""
It sucks Adam you just can't help but get fucked by the guys you look up to
I said you either real or you ain't dawg, there ain't no in-between
We ain't cut from the same cloth, I'm tailor made for the game or so it would seem
Cause when it comes to rhyming I'm on top if you know what I mean
You a cup of noodle, I'll peel your lid back just to blow off some steam
Infrared beams look like techno lasers
Dealership maintenance you just met your maker
So now's a good time to go ahead and accept your savior
Before I make the Devil your fucking next door neighbor
I said that's a sign you're a bitch, I ain't here to impress no haters
I said the deuce deuce is a good buy/bye, I protect my paper
In a fair one, you won't fare well, I don't respect yo' gangsta
Plus I got a piece so long it'll catch you later
Bitch

[Round 2: Rone]
Man, that fucking gangsta shit is the weirdest shit I've heard about you
I talked to the rest of the white battle rappers and to be honest
The fellas are getting worried about you
Bro, it's like you can't decide if you're Jamal or Geppetto
An Italian who acts black? Where you from, the Spaghetto?
Talking about this fake drug dealer shit
Selling, copping, never stopping
Bragging 'bout who he sold to, Benny, Robby, Jenny, Johnny
He even made a deal in a Denny's lobby with Hammurabi
Bro, you know who else sold weed before? Fucking everybody!
Bro, my little sister, sold packs of loud shit
You don't hear her bragging 'bout it
My grandma's stylist was packing ounces
Shit, so was my dad's accountant
If you do all this secret illegal shit then why would you tell us?
He's like, ""Gangsters move in silence
And did I mention I sell drugs?""
Well, I roof whatever drugs you got
I'm talking crack, pills, heroin
Even if it's legal drugs, I'm talking Advil, Claritin
I'll throw your bitch off the roof like I'm Dan Bilzerian
I'll throw your shoes on the phone line while your man's still wearing 'em
You wife her, I'll snipe her like click click boom, La Di Da Di
She on the patch then I'm Slick Rick smooth
I'll send a photo of the bands then send a dick pic through
That's the chicken and the beef like a McPick 2
But I got a top five reasons you should not rap
Number 1: you are a cable guy for Comcast
You know what? Fuck the list, we can stop flat
Reasons one through five, they are all that
Fucking cable guys deserve a special section of Hell
Where the Devil tortures them sometime between seven and twelve
Fucking Fairy the Cable Guy, our second battle isn't stressing me
But I feel like Matthew Broderick cause the Cable Guy is obsessed with me
So this for every time you said 'five' and showed up after six
This is for every stranger's toilet that you clogged with a massive shit
This is for every shitty operator y'all have ever had talk to me
Every one of them in India who claims they're down the block from me
Fucking cable companies are an inherently un-American symbol
Comcast runs a Monopoly and you just play the thimble
So I want remunerations for dealing with your faggot shit
So after I beat you, you're hooking me up with all of the sports packages
You know what? Fuck all the sports packages
I don't want sports packages let me be more accurate
I want the porn packages
Fucking Skinemax? Gimme that
Bunny Ranch? I fucks with that
He's already asked but here's something you should know about me now
If I can't have battle rap I will burn it to the ground
I mean, Dizaster's been ducking me like I'm not in that class
Dizaster's been ducking me like some kind of Math class
I heard Tay Roc run his mouth, how is he a threat?
Bro, I would take care of Roc like a Chia Pet
Bro, I would take care of Roc like a PG vet
Bro, I would take care of Roc like a vet PG
I whip Roc like Nash when he's MVP
I would get rid of Roc like it's NBD
I'll 30 Roc like the studios at NBC
And y'all might think I'm losing focus, but maybe you should know this
Before the battle I Instagram'd evidence that he doesn't write his own shit
So log onto @adamferrone to read every word now
Or just wait, cause we'll get into it in that third round

[Round 3: Caustic]
Yo, you mentioned my homie Ron...I swear to God I'm a writer
Bitch I could check this dick and feel nothing, I'm like Bonnie Godiva
They said, ""Caustic, did you see Day 1? 'Cane was snapping.""
I was like, ""Yeah, yes. But all his good lines were about me so I guess he still needs Caustic bars to get a major reaction.""
I said, oh you didn't buy nothing right, 'Cane?
What the fuck were you paying for when you made the transaction?
You know what? You can just walk around with this L but I guess Stranger Things have happened
I said my dude came
It was three years I was hoping that you'd change
But you're still the same bum begging for bars with loose change
I said you still got your mouth wrapped around another dude's name
You're like a shamed Olympian blaming the steroids for the poor decisions that you made
I said, Al can fucking blow me
At this point Al owes me some alimony
Acting like I snitched on somebody, no I just alerted my actual homie
About some fucking stranger who didn't pay me the fucking full amount that he owes me
But I'm no angle though
We've all gotten a couple bars along the way, you know?
But shit if we wanna talk about the ratio
I don't need a bunch of Facebook conversations posted to tell you what I gave to Rone
Oh...did you forgot?
When we were out there in England?
Don't Flop for the weekend
You couldn't finish your rounds cause you was too busy drinking
I gave you a whole round for Youthoracle right in front of you without even blinking
You're like, ""Hey, thanks Caustic I'm sorry I choked. But you don't write how I be normally speaking
But hey it'd be cool if we could keep this our little secret.""
Awww, you little fucking faggot dude
Aye, you mad at me?
What about a week before your battle with T
And didn't have much help to give you but I did give you a little something, didn't I, you manatee?

[Rone]
Never

[Caustic]
Never?
I mean imagine me
Bunch of people get credit for my writtens
But I can tell you like this, I've taken a lot less than I've given
So whoever's feeding you your information is telling you some fucking fiction
And besides, Erik Foreman helped you write this whole fucking battle so what's the fucking difference?!
No?
See, if you look at his name it'll prove that he's a hypocrite in the long run
Cause he likes to sit around and call people frauds even though you R-one
I said I know who I am, these battlers should have a natural fear
But this is your second title match
I've had bars in title matches for the last three and half years
And if you're confused, you think that shit is weird
And you don't think that shit is actually true
Then why aren't you taking a second and ask half of the fucking battlers in this room
But it's Rone!
It's Rone who they've given me
He composes it like a symphony
He's simply, says simple things a bunch of filler schemes and similes
But he hides it behind this whiny high pitched delivery
So you can't tell he's the least quotable rapper in King Of The Dot history
I mean every since you became a little mini-celebrity
You think you got all the answers like that guinea from Jeopardy
I'm sick of this fucking rich dickhead kid disrespecting me
The only privileged I ever had in my life was a fifth of Hennessy
And after I finish that I'm gonna find your little sister Stephanie
And dig her the fuck out like a hysterectomy
See him and Erik Foreman have been on the internet instant messaging
Desperately trying to discredit me
To make me lose I swear to God they'll do anything
But, I've got enemies
Got a lot of enemies but both you faggots 'bout to get the same vasectomy
But since you're a man of education let's look at it scientifically
You lost momentum while I gave it a simple transfer of energy
Cause if you break it down to the chemistry
Your volume to the masses doesn't have any density
Cause even in the most basic of matters
You just can't trust Adams cause they make up everything

[Rone]
You're a liar, bro, you're a liar

[Caustic]
I'm a liar? I'm a liar? That's your observation?
The best you got is a 2012 Photoshop conversation?
Suck a fucking dick, that shit is fucking finished
You're supposed to be a fucking champion, now you out here coming with gimmicks
Dude that shit is fucking actually true
If you were a real fucking champion you would've showed up to the event and interacted with fans like champions do
Your trend ended before you started, you're the Ed Hardy of battling dude
Dude, I was gonna retire after I won this shit
That's some shit I thought I never would say
I was just gonna take the chain and left y'all for dead
Then I thought about it, is that really how this legend will end?
Then I said, fuck it
I'd rather stay and break Pat's record instead!
Let's go!

[Round 3: Rone]
So this is not a regular battle round
You know, a verse on his weaknesses
So fuck a crowd, fuck a crown, these are personal grievances
So let's not mince words
You missed your first battle with Big T cause you were hungover from some bad coke
On Friday you're doing great, the next day you can't go
Once the fans had their money paid and that's why you're fucking fake
Cause you were in Chicago at the venue but couldn't go because a tummy ache?
Bro, what the eff is that?
How is he your expecting champ when he might miss any heavy scratch from a bout of the menstrual cramps?
Fuck losing any respect, mine for dude didn't exist
Cause I did the same drugs and was fine, your immune system's a bitch
But the very worst thing from the scene from that night
Worse than Mr. Free Drugs being a fiend for that white
Is your slogan, ""Free Drugs""
I was believing the hype
And then I watched you pay for those shitty drugs at a fucking premium price
I mean, what happened to the slogan, dawg? I really believed that
When I say ""Grandmom's favorite grandson,"" ask my grandmom, I really mean that
But yo, there's something bigger about your fame that has driven me insane
How you made your whole name off of ghostwriting for Arcane
But behind the scenes us battlers know you in a different way
You are the most notorious recipient of shared bars in the game
Oh y'all want names?
Y'all want names?
Fresco never gave you bars?
Fredo never gave you bars?
Frank Stacks never gave you bars?
D-Lor never gave you bars?
Fucking Reverse Live never gave you bars?
Fucking Real Deal never gave you bars?
Bro, fucking Marvwon never gave you bars?
Madness never gave you bars?
Bro, and that's the ones I know, imagine ones I don't
Imagine all his secrets if that's the stuff he shows
I mean the first time he called me for bars we weren't even bros then
It was against fucking Roosevelt and that was back in '010
It's really just incredible what he does behind the scenes

I watched five battlers give him bars for Mr. 13
Vers' Arsonal, Chedda Cheese, every battle it's obscene
Last year vers' Big T it was full four bar schemes
And you still skipped the battle after I directly gave you bars
So stop lying you are not genius that you claim you are
Battles on 24 hours notice really aren't that exciting for him
When you realize he probably has like 24 people writing for him
I mean, fucking getting bars, burning bridges, that just shows he's a selfish guy
His slogan ""Free Drugs"" that explains his health's decline
But after all his snitching it was on himself this time
Cause Mr. Free Drugs has always needed someone else's lines
And the way you vilified Arcane when you are ten times the cheater
That's like getting ethic lessons from fucking Carlos Mencia
Go and get your ghostwriters I guarantee they're not enough
Oh you write your own shit? Yeah so does Melania Trump
I said you really can't compare duke
I say shit they're scared to
You dig dirt, find someone that's written for me, I fucking dare you!
Bro, this is for all that bad karma you built up
All that cattiness displayed
Because all of that bad karma that comes back to you TODAY
So I hope you get STDs to what you said to Q-Shinobi
Based on what you said to K, I hope you lose one of your closest homies
For what you said to Caddy I wish you dope scared veins
And your mom deserves to die for what you said about Arcane
Based on Soul, I hope your girl moves away, far from you
From Jeff, I hope she cheats, just to make it hard from you
From Ex-I I hope you know the guy
And just to make it horrible
I hope it's one of your best friends from what you said to Arsonal
I hope they run a train on her from what you said to Cortez
I hope she gets a restraining order from what you said to Megadeath
Then I hope you get back together and the two of you have babies
And I hope that fucking kid's retarded from what you said to Matt Daley
Bro, you are a rat and a snake
That's just how I see him
This is bigger than rap beefing, both coasts or regions
So I'm not lobbying for a win and I don't care if you believe it
But any league where he's the champ isn't one I want to be in","[('We‚Äôre at World Domination 6, right? The whole globe is watching me\n Ain‚Äôt that about a bitch?

Aye, turn my headphones up
I'm talking straight shit
I got money now motherfucker
I had money then but this real money bitch
Hahahah, ohh

King size papers, king size bed
Niggas blow money but I'd rather keep mine instead
Roll something nigga, blow something
Say you're ballin out of control, let a nigga hold something
Especially if you got it and he don't put his niggas on
Tell me what's the sense of even having it fo'
Cause when you're broke, you'll have everything to gain
When you lose it all, let you inhale out the vape
Do it for the taste
Usually I roll one up to pass around but now I'm smokin' to the face
Cause chiefing with niggas is such a waste
Unless they my niggas
And nine times out of ten, they got their own pound with them
Own pack of papers and filters, something to grind
We be smoking them things like six at a time, five in the air
Four breakin' down, three in my head, two on my mind, nigga

One rolled, one rolled, one rolled
I keep more than one rolled, one rolled, one rolled
One rolled, one rolled, one rolled
I keep more than one rolled, one rolled, one rolled
I keep more than

A bit of a pothead, it has been said
I keep one rolled up like LL's pantlegs
Full of life in this bitch, though I may seem half-dead
Trust me, I'm cool, I just ain't talking to you
And them checks coming through as just as I predicted
Got a bigger portion cause the Jets eating off bigger dishes now
Ain't I the biggest fish up in this pond?
Since life's a bitch, tell her roll my shit up huh
Secret compartment in my car, James Bond
Though I'm James Bong, nigga bread long
And my name known in e'ry home household
Caught them pussies slippin' tryna squeeze in the mouse hole
That cheese is not yours, you are not chose by the gods
To live as we do so play your role in the movie, ain't no pause
No rewind for no man, wait time, so I ain't wasting mine
More grass, more green, more grind
Nigga I keep

Roll around with a bunch of get-rich ass niggas
Who the man? You ain't even gotta ask these niggas
I'mma fuck around and take these niggas' last three pictures
Man these bitches breaking they neck just to pass weed with us
We roll, get high, get drunk, more shots, reload
Too high, he knows, three more, C4, we blow
Bitch, how could you be so fine?
Shake that ass, she so mine
Taking more double shots than free throw lines
I might hit like three, four times

Can't take a step
Then take my hand
If you love me, you'll wait
Something up ahead
Just don't be scared
If you love me, stay with me

[Pre-Chorus]
More than a life of this panic
If you love me, you'll wait for me
Our dreams won't be surely forgotten
If you love me, you'll wait for me
You'll wait for me, you'll wait for me
You'll wait for me, you'll wait for me

[Chorus]
If you love me, you'll wait for me
If you love me, you'll wait for me

[Verse 2]
I'm flying up past high
Call the air support
There's nothing left in us that can keep us whole

[Pre-Chorus]
More than a life of this panic
If you love me, you'll wait for me
Our dreams won't be surely forgotten
If you love me, you'll wait for me
You'll wait for me, you'll wait for me
You'll wait for me, you'll wait for me

[Chorus]
If you love me, you'll wait for me
If you love me, you'll wait for me

[Outro]
If you love me, just stay with me
If you need another love song
Just tell me, I can write it
If you need another spaceship
Just tell me, I can find it",,0.9953,0.9953,0.0851,Energised
