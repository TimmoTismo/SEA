I thought that I was dreamin' when you said you love me
The start of nothin', I had no chance to prepare
I couldn't see you comin'
The start of nothin', ooh, I could hate you now
It's quite alright to hate me now
When we both know that deep down
The feeling still deep down is good

If I could see through walls, I could see you're faking
If you could see my thoughts, you would see our faces
Safe in my rental like an armored truck back then
We didn't give a fuck back then
I ain't a kid no more, we'll never be those kids again
We'd drive to Syd's, had the X6 back then, back then
No matter what I did, my waves wouldn't dip back then
Everything sucked back then, we were friends

The feeling still deep down is good

In the halls of your hotel
Arm around my shoulder so I could tell
How much I meant to you, meant it sincere back then
We had time to kill back then
You ain't a kid no more, we'll never be those kids again
It's not the same, ivory's illegal, don't you remember?

I broke your heart last week

He and the other person matured in their own ways, now simply viewing it all as “good times”. His time with them is like the time one spends in a hotel during vacation. It’s a temporary trip away from your normal life, often because you’re visiting a foreign environment, experiencing what that new place has to offer.']]), ('I broke your heart last week\n You’ll probably feel better by the weekend\n Still remember, had you going crazy\n Screamin’ my name, the feeling deep down is good', [['Frank notes how quickly (two weeks) the song’s subject is able to recover from a heartbreak.\n\nWhile the sexual feeling was intense, the subject’s feelings turned out to be superficial, seeing as they were able to quickly shed the attachment and get over Frank. This may symbolize how fast a relationship can grow and self-destruct: what was once seen as a perfect moment is nothing more than just a memory now. Frank’s partner can only move on with life because that’s all they can do.']]), ('You ain’t a kid no more, we’ll never be those kids again\n It’s not the same, ivory’s illegal, don’t you remember?', [['Frank and the person he’s singing about have grown up and grew apart. While they’ll “never be those kids again,” Frank keeps that memory as a piece of their relationship.\n\nIvory, a hard, white material obtained from elephant tusks was banned in 1989 due to the rapidly decreasing elephant population, but before that, was used to make luxury drug accessories. Ivory is also slang for cocaine, Frank may be saying that their love affair involved some long nights on cocaine, and have become more aware of the legal repercussions of it as they grew older. He’s essentially saying that their love was a product of their reckless youth and was heightened by drugs, but now that they’ve grown up it will forever remain just a perfect memory.\n\n\n\nIvory also has an off-white color, which may be referring to a tainted innocence since white has a positive connotation of purity and cleanliness.\n\nThe use of the term, “ivory” is most likely an intentional use of wordplay that ties the song together. The ivy plant is an invasive species, while ivory is something precious. This could show the duality of the relationship and how it went from something precious to something toxic or invasive like ivy.']]), ('All the things I didn’t mean to say, I didn’t mean to do\n There were things you didn’t need to say\n Did you mean to? Mean to\n I’ve been dreamin’ of you, dreamin’ of you\n I’ve been dreamin’ of you, dreamin’ of you\n I’ve been dreamin’, dreaming', [['Frank is overcome with emotion and regret about what happened between him and his former lover. It’s possible that this monologue has taken place while Frank is lying in bed, half-asleep and dreaming of this old lover, fitting with the gauze of the shoe-gaze guitars that are draped over the song.\n\nAs Frank becomes angered and begins to scream, his voice becomes altered by the grain delay. The scream, delivered almost as a crescendo, is a culmination of emotions and represents Frank’s deep longing and heartache. By the end of the song, he expresses his frustration physically and breaks the other objects around him.']]), ('I thought that I was dreamin’ when you said you love me\n The start of nothin’, I had no chance to prepare\n I couldn’t see you comin’\n The start of nothin’, ooh, I could hate you now\n It’s quite alright to hate me now\n When we both know that deep down\n The feeling still deep down is good', [['Frank describes the beginning of a now failed relationship. In this reflective line, the words “the start of nothing” point to the relationship being doomed from the start – although he was blissfully unaware at the beginning. Overtime, both parties ended up hurting each other and as a result, Frank believes he can hate them for changing the good friendship that they once had into something he wasn’t ready for.\n\nFurthermore, he could mean by having “no time to prepare” that he wanted to be a better version of himself before the relationship started. But because they jumped into this unexpected love affair, perhaps he still had internal issues he was dealing with, and ended up hurting the other person as a result.\n\n“The start of nothing” also sounds similar to “it started from nothing”. This re-enforces that he was overwhelmed when his partner told him they loved him—he wasn’t emotionally prepared. Perhaps, this relationship blossomed from a long time friendship, and here the friend tells him that they intimately love him. The relationship burgeoned out of nowhere then became more serious but they eventually separated all the same, destroying the friendship they had too.']]), ('We’d drive to Syd’s,', [['This is a nod to one of Frank’s good friends, Syd tha Kid, lead singer of the neo-RnB group The Internet and former member of Odd Future.\n\nSyd and Taco’s house was the place where Odd Future members used to hang out. Frank relishes in the memories of simpler times and just messing around with his friends.']]), ('Safe in my rental like an armored truck back then\n We didn’t give a fuck back then\n I ain’t a kid no more, we’ll never be those kids again', [['Frank and the person he’s singing about have grown up and apart. Back when he was younger, Frank could go through life “armored” against the hurt. But now that he’s matured, he is feeling it all—the consequences of his actions, the hole left in his life by the absence of this lover. The mistakes we make as kids may not kill us in the moment, but we tend to pay for them later with regret and sorrow.\n\nLike an armored truck, the emotional walls Frank put up when he was younger were hard to get past—he didn’t let this person fully in. While this made him safer, it may be the reason why their relationship ended.\n\nFrank may also be referencing the now-dissolved group he was once a part of, Odd Future, which leads into the next line, referencing another former member Syd. The group’s leader, Tyler, the Creator had once called the group as “kids fucked up in their mental.”']]), ('If I could see through walls, I could see you’re faking\n If you could see my thoughts, you would see our faces', [['“Seeing through walls” means to see someone clearly for what they are—beyond the emotional barriers they may put up to prevent further heartache. The person Frank is addressing isn’t being true to themselves or their relationship with Frank. This leads Frank to fantasize about having them back in his life.\n\nFrank juxtaposes the hidden feelings he and his lover are hiding behind physical and metaphorical emotional barriers. While his lover is static behind a  “wall” that seems to be permanently obscuring the truth, Frank’s own emotional barrier is dynamic and impermanent in nature. There also appears to be a contrast between how the person could be faking whereas Frank is almost hiding his feelings altogether, exhibiting that there is insecurity in this relationship.']]), ('Had the X6 back then, back then', [['In a 2012 interview, Tyler, The Creator commented: “I remember Frank had a nice ass car and would always take us places.” It seems Frank’s car may have been the BMW X6 SUV crossover. The X6 premiered with its first model in 2009, so “back then” was at least that recent.\n\n\n\nIn his NYT profile, it’s revealed that Frank keeps at minimum 3 Beemers at the ready.\n\nHe rents three parking spots for three different BMWs.\n\nIn addition, he was having a “vintage 1990 BMW E30 sedan [be] rebuilt to his exact specifications,” much like the one featured on the cover of his mixtape nostalgia, ULTRA.']]), ('No matter what I did, my waves wouldn’t dip back then\n Everything sucked back then, we were friends', [['Waves are a hairstyle formed by brushing and laying down the curls in the hair into a curl pattern. Wavers commonly refer to a nice wave pattern as dipping.\n\n\n\nFrank uses “waves” to draw parallels of the pre-success and pre-loss-of-innocence period in his life with his current successful, morbidly real situation. Frank points out how simple things didn’t go his way back then, continuing the reflective theme of the song as Frank looks back on his younger, innocent days.\n\n“Waves” are also an analogy to everything valuable to that person. Since a person can not force a “dip” – a successful relationship – in such a short amount of time, Frank expresses how his partner has lost hope.']])]",0.1996,0.1996,0.456,Sad

As a result, this line could take on two different meanings depending on the listener’s interpretation of the phrase “love is endless.”\n\nOn one hand, Billie is asking the listener, her love interest, not to attach too much importance to the phrase “love is endless” and to say it anyways because her life is about to end.  In her mind, the person speaking to her could be lying for all she knows, but it doesn’t matter because they won’t be held accountable for the lie when she’s gone.  This ties in well with the next line “leave me like you do,” because her love interest could simply say that their love is endless and leave after her death without consequences of saying it.  Therefore, Billie is telling them not to be so pretentious and just say it.\n\nOn the other hand, “love is endless” in itself could be viewed a pretentious statement because Billie’s love interest will likely find someone else after her death. Therefore making her love with this person, in fact, not endless. This interpretation presents a paradox that could serve as a metaphor to describe the next phase of Billie’s death.  In the previous line, Billie described how she would first stop breathing and turn blue.  The next sequence of her death could be mental incapacitation in which she would not be able to understand that the statement she made is, in fact, contradictory.']]), ('Call my friends and tell them that I love them\n And I’ll miss them\n But I’m not sorry\n Call my friends and tell them that I love them\n And I’ll miss them\n Sorry', [['Being sorry is a motif that is referenced throughout the song. The “sorry” mentioned here by Billie depicts two opposing images that are distinguished by the lines “But I’m not sorry” and “Sorry.” Billie juxtaposes the two sets of lyrics, the first set references feeling depressed and ultimately suicidal, and being unapologetic about having committed to killing oneself. While both sets mentions calling one’s friends and expressing last remarks of love, the first set represents an “explanation” while the second set represents the suicidal attempt itself.\n\nDuring the outro, sirens can clearly be heard in the background, suggesting that the decision has not just been made, but the act has already been attempted.']]), ('Leave me, déjà vu (Hmm)', [['In this line Billie tells the listener, her love interest to leave her. She emphasizes the line by using the word “déja-vu” meaning “the feeling of repetition, or familiarity, when in actuality, it is your first time experiencing it.”. Billie is telling this person to leave her cause she is already used to it and it is a familiar feeling for her to experience abandonment, it has happened to her before or has felt like it.']]), ('If you need me, wanna see me\n Better hurry ‘cause I’m leavin’ soon', [['Having more depth than a typical love song about heartbreak, this song flips standard love song tropes about “leaving” and makes them darker, slyly referencing an impending suicide attempt. Thus, this chorus can be referencing both an impending breakup and an impending suicide.\n\nThe reference to suicide is backed by the chilling lines in Verse 1:\n\nI wanna see the world when I stop breathing\nTurning blue']])]",0.8672,0.8672,0.0993,Sad

Beating on his chest like a bongo
He understands she's coming from a hurt place
Answers all the questions on her survey
Doesn't get jealous, doesn't break trust
Doesn't call her, ""Ho"" after hang-ups
Give her everything she ever wanted
And even though she still feels haunted

Contrary to popular opinion, Billie did not record the line, “but my head was underwater,” underwater. Instead, they applied an underwater sound effect to her vocals.\n\nThis line also parallels another line from Billie’s January 2019 song, “bury a friend,” where she sings about sleep paralysis:\n\nThe debt I owe, gotta sell my soul\n‘Cause I can’t say no, no, I can’t say no\nThen my limbs all froze and my eyes won’t close\nAnd I can’t say no, I can’t say no\n\nIn a November 2018 Instagram livestream, Billie talked about her experience with sleep paralysis:\n\nI tried to look around, and my head wouldn’t move. And I kept moving my arm… but my arm wouldn’t fucking move […] and I did what your brain tells your leg to do but that shit did not move. So I was like… shit this is fucked. I tried to scream “Mom” [and I couldn’t scream]. It was the scariest shit in my life. Also, I didn’t know what sleep paralysis was, so I was like “I’m dying, this is it bro, I’m gone, bye.” I didn’t even get to say goodbye to all the people I love.\n\nBeing unable to move limbs or speak are common symptoms of sleep paralysis. However, some people experience terrifying hallucinations in combination with sleep paralysis, which may trigger feelings of helplessness. In a March 2019 interview with Fader, Billie also revealed that she experiences both terrifying nightmares and dreams that are too good to be true:\n\nI’m sure somebody’s gonna be like, ‘oh, it’s your brain doing this,’ but, like, you cannot give me a good explanation. I do not understand. Dreams are a really intense part of my life. I’ll go through a month where I’ll have the same nightmare every single night—a dream that’s so bad that the whole day is off, or a dream that’s so good that none of it’s true.\n\nThe lyric may also allude to lyrics in Phoebe Bridgers' 2017 track, “Funeral:”\n\nAnd I have this dream where I’m screaming underwater\nWhile my friends are waving from the shore""]]), ('And you say, ”As long as I’m here, no one can hurt you\n Don’t wanna lie here, but you can learn to\n If I could change the way that you see yourself\n You wouldn’t wonder why you hear\n ‘They don’t deserve you’”', [['Billie spoke about the strong relationship she has with her brother FINNEAS in a November 2019 interview with BBC Radio 1:\n\nmy brother is my best friend and I have these dreams and these things happen and no matter what happens he’s gonna always be there for me and it’s the same the other way around.\n\nShe also sent the following message to her fans via email:']]), ('Thought I could fly (Fly)\n So I stepped off the Golden, mm\n Nobody cried (Cried, cried, cried, cried)\n Nobody even noticed\n I saw them standing right there\n Kinda thought they might care (Might care, might care)', [[""The Golden Gate Bridge, which is depicted on the song’s cover art, is the second-most used suicide site in the world behind the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge in China.

But eventually, her constant energy tires them out, and they leave her.\n\nShe’s come to expect this pattern so often that she can’t even bring herself to enjoy the initial “perfect summer” part of a new relationship where her partner genuinely enjoys her company, because she knows it won’t last long. In this moment, she has an epiphany that maybe she is really better off without her previous partners, and that there’s more to life than just one person, or just one season.\n\nLorde said to NME that this was her favorite lyric on the record.\n\nI’m really proud of the little moment in “Liability”: “I know that it’s exciting / running through the night, but / every perfect summer’s / eating me alive until you’re gone!” That little “every perfect summer’s eating me alive” was really one of the pillars of the record, and I was super stoked with it. It’s got a lot to it for six words.\n\nReminiscing on “perfect summers” is a common theme in the album such as in “The Louvre” where she sings:\n\nWell, summer slipped us underneath her tongue…']]), ('He don’t wanna know me\n Says he made the big mistake of dancing in my storm\n Says it was poison', [['In a podcast with The Spinoff, Lorde implies that lyrics like these may be exaggerated, the result of her “being a bit of a drama queen.”\n\nThat’s the point of all this though, she should be expected to act this way at certain points given the title of the album.  As she puts it,\n\neveryone who talks to me about that song gives me this look like I’m dying of a terminal disease … but I think that is the nature of writing a record called Melodrama.\n\nThe exaggerated nature of the line juxtaposes the simplicity of the first lyric.']]), ('The truth is I am a toy that people enjoy\n Till all of the tricks don’t work anymore\n And then they are bored of me', [['These lines could refer to Lorde’s role as an artist and entertainer. Fans enjoy the music she creates, but she fears that someday people will find her music repetitive, and they’ll begin to grow tired of her, throwing her away like children would a toy.\n\nIt could also reference a pattern she sees in her relationships–after the initial thrill of dating her passes, her lovers get bored of her usual antics, and start viewing her as a burden. She may also be referencing to how she feels that she is being used by people and then discarded once they get what they want from her.\n\nLorde shared this sentiment from as early as 2013 when she began her career in the spotlight, telling The Guardian:\n\nI’ve been in some situations where people have treated me like a fascinating toy. You know, it’s just like an interesting kind of fun thing to have a play with. It’s very weird for me.

But since light often represents goodness and transcendence, Lorde’s choice to vanish into the sun (the ultimate source of light) shows she expects to have a satisfying and successful future.\n\nAt a concert she changed these lyrics after she explained how “Liability” was her way of loving her own weird-ness and recognizing that it’s how she’s connected with so many people:\n\nI remember a friend of mine called himself an acquired taste. I like that. I mean if you’re in this room you’re probably a bit of an acquired taste. But that means you’re magic. That means– I know who you are. I know how you dream. I know how you think.

When used in comparison with the current track, a significant change in Abel’s life and his ways is depicted.\n\nThe tables have definitely turned since his Thursday mixtape, in the most ironic of ways. He now finds himself in love with someone, begging her not to leave. He asks her to stay a little longer in order to ease the pain of her future departure, much as the woman on The Birds (Part 2) asked him years ago.\n\nAs painful as this may be for him, it does portray his emotional growth in relation to woman. He allowed himself to care for someone enough to get hurt.']]), ('Guess I was just another pit stop\n ’Til you made up your mind\n You just wasted my time', [['A pit stop refers to the pit where a racecar driver stops in the middle of a race to refuel and/or service the vehicle.\n\n\n\nThe Weeknd uses a pit stop as a metaphor to suggest that a girl whom he “put on top” had just used him for her own needs, almost in the same vein that a car refuels at a pit stop. He states that she had not actually been in love with him in the same way he had felt towards her.\n\nThis is most likely a reference to his relationship with fellow singer Selena Gomez. Selena and Abel broke up on October 30, 2017, after 10 months of dating; the very next day photos emerged of Selena reuniting with her former boyfriend Justin Bieber (whom she split in 2015). Hence, Abel would have been Selena’s metaphorical pit stop.']]), ('I said I didn’t feel nothing, baby, but I lied', [['Abel is notorious for his sexual escapades. He has not only spoken about his sexual prowess but also how detached he is in sexual situations and relationships. This physical-emotional detachment has been a constant theme in his music since his first mixtape, House of Balloons, and essentially facilitated the underlying plot of his second mixtape Thursday. This is almost as consistent and ever-present as allusions to his myriad drug-fueled adventures.\n\nHowever in “Adaptation” he demonstrates a self-awareness and desire for a meaningful feeling involved relationship:\n\nThen I realized\nShe might have been the one\nI let it go\nFor a little fun\n\nSo while he likely warned her that he was trouble along the lines of his famous line from “The Zone”:\n\nI can’t feel a damn thing\n\nAt his core, Abel does have a capacity to love. So despite saying he didn’t harbor any real feelings towards her, as he admits, he lied.\n\nThis isn’t the first time Abel has boasted about lying either, on “Montreal” he boasts how it comes natural to him,\n\nCuz ain’t nobody feels the way that I feel when I’m alone\nSo if I said that I won’t call\nThe lying comes natural to me']]), ('We found each other\n I helped you out of a broken place\n You gave me comfort\n But falling for you was my mistake', [['Abel is likely referring to his ex-girlfriend, Selena Gomez, whom he dated from January to October 2017. During this relatively short period, he helped her through her battle with Lupus, even canceling a few shows on his “Legend of the Fall” tour to be by her side.\n\nAccording to an insider:\n\nAbel has been one of her biggest supports. She had been traveling with him on his tour and he was off during her surgery and right after during her recovery.\n\nGomez also consistently appeared on Abel’s social handles. For example, during their vacation to Italy at the end of January, she appeared on his Instagram story.\n\nhttps://da4pli3l5vc0d.cloudfront.net/d2/bf/d2bf9143b7ec6d247f83f40b3688acceec0e788b/h=365/?app=portal&sig=32e6c02246ced33a49cf23e159f829db8847ec486289040623f1a9b19c828901']]), ('I almost cut a piece of myself for your life', [['Selena Gomez has consistently struggled with serious health issues due to her Lupus diagnosis.  The ordeal became worse during her relationship with The Weeknd, and she had to go through surgery in order to have a kidney transplant to circumvent eventual death from the disease.\n\nIn this case, the often metaphorical phrase “cut a piece of myself” could also be very literal; fans have theorized that Abel was possibly willing to donate one of his kidneys in order to save his girlfriend’s life.\n\nHer best friend, Francia Raísa, ended up being her kidney donor, but Abel worked his tour around her surgery and cancelled one of his shows on his “Legend of The Fall” tour to be by Selena’s side during the ordeal.']])]",0.9886,0.9886,0.1918,Sad

She’s effectively saying she’s younger than a kid, highlighting the youth of both Phoebe and the person whose funeral it is. It could also imply she feels older than her actual age.']]), ('Jesus Christ, I’m so blue all the time', [['The use of “Jesus Christ” in the chorus is interesting when taken in context. In the first chorus, it follows the line “I don’t believe in that stuff anymore.” This suggests that in addition to dream interpretations, religion is something that no longer provides intrinsic meaning to Phoebe. In the second chorus, it follows the line “Someone’s kid is dead.” In Christianity, Jesus is the Son of God who was killed for our sins. Perhaps in the face of this tragedy, Phoebe can see (even if she does not believe) how Christian belief could be comforting to others who see God as having experienced their grief.']]), ('And I have this dream where I’m screaming underwater\n While my friends are waving from the shore', [['This dream she is having could be interpreted in many ways by people who interpret dreams. Why are none of her friends saving her? Maybe it is an analogy for her sadness, that she feels alone in her suffering and feels as though her friends cannot help her out of it.

Her detailing this specific dream in the song does, however, raise the possibility that a part of her finds her dreams, or at least this one, significant in some way.']]), ('When I think too much about it I can’t breathe', [['Panic from thinking about difficult or anxiety-inducing topics such as death could make it harder to breathe']]), ('Jesus Christ, I’m so blue all the time\n And that’s just how I feel\n Always have and I always will\n I always have and always will', [['When people feel sad and especially when people are experiencing symptoms of depression it’s common to feel like that’s the way things have always been.

I said that something must be

I said, but we all need a hand, when we're standing on glass with no shoes
So you said I'm tired of this loneliness
Hiding out deep in my bones

Every evening, every dawn

She said, you're also human, you've been through loneliness too
I said, darling, the words that you speak, you know they are true

But the sun always rises, and the spring always comes when it's time
And it takes light to see shadows, it takes pain to see love truly shine
So I'll wait for the sunrise and try not to miss shooting stars
