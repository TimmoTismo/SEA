At the time of this release, Drake was nineteen-years-old and was simultaneously acting on the Canadian tv series Degrassi: The Next Generation. Drake’s catalog of albums can be seen here and his catalog of mixtapes can be seen here. Since releasing Room for Improvement, Drake has indeed shown quite the improvement in regard to sales, streams, awards and more. A number of Drake’s accolades can be seen here.']]), ('I’m on the hot one hundo, numero uno\n This one ain’t come with a bundle', [['Drake broke the record last year for most Billboard Hot 100 entries ever with 208. He also became the first male artist with three number one arrivals on the Hot 100 charts with his quarantine-inspired single “Toosie Slide”. Needless to say, Drake is no stranger to being number one.\n\nHe also sends a slick shot at artists who achieve these same feats through the use of merchandise and album bundle sales, a practice that has since been banned by Billboard. Relevant artists including Travis Scott, Nicki Minaj, and Tyler, The Creator, gave out free album downloads in exchange for the purchase of a merch item. This catapulted the success of Travis Scott’s ASTROWORLD and Tyler’s IGOR, allowing their albums to reach No. 1 on Billboard, beating out Nicki Minaj and DJ Khaled respectively.\n\nDrake’s recent mixtape Dark Lane Demo Tapes was also beat out for a No. 1 spot by Kenny Chesney’s Here and Now due to merch and album bundle sales.\n\nSurely enough, this song debuted at #1 on the Billboard Hot 100.\nhttps://twitter.com/chartdata/status/1371516088148705281']]), ('He thought he was sick, now he wipin’ his nose, okay', [['A double play on words. This guy who thought he was too cool (“sick”) ended up dead (“wiping his nose”), probably for being too flashy and getting robbed.']]), ('A boss is a role that I’ve grown into', [['Along with his come-up in the rap game, Drake has increasingly become a boss of the music industry as well as other business ventures.\n\nIn 2018, Drake referenced his boss standing on Meek Mill’s “Going Bad,” where he rapped:\n\nYou asked to see the boss, so they sent me, dawg (Sent me, dawg)']]), ('I sit in a box where the owners do', [['A luxury box is the most exclusive place to sit at a sports arena. This is likely a reference to his close relationship with the Toronto Raptors, the NBA team in his home city. Although he does not have an ownership stake, he has been the team’s official Global Ambassador since 2013.']]), ('I’m in the Wynn, a million in chocolate chips\n And that’s just how my cookie crumble', [['Wynn is a brand of high-end hotels, based in  Paradise, Nevada. On September 12, 2019, Drake partnered with its Las Vegas location by opening an OVO pop-up boutique there. The collaboration coincided with Drake’s performance at the hotel two days later on the 14th.\n\n“A million in chocolate chips” refers to money and “that’s just how my cookie crumble” is a play on the phrase “that’s the way the cookie crumbles,” which means that one should accept the way things are. Essentially, Drake is saying he has a lot of money and that it should be accepted.']]), ('Weezy had handed it off, I still got no fumbles', [['In American Football, a “fumble” is when an offensive player loses possession of a ball before scoring or going out of bounds.\n\n“Weezy” is Lil Wayne’s nickname. He signed Drake to his label Young Money Records back in 2009, following the release of breakout commercial mixtape, So Far Gone.\n\n Since then, Drake has released countless hits and has gone on to be one of the most successful artists of all time. Drake uses the “fumble” football metaphor to note that he hasn’t flopped once in his music career since Wayne signed him.']]), ('Well, summer, all I did was rest, okay?\n And New Year’s, all I did was stretch, okay?\n And Valentine’s Day, I had sex, okay?\n We’ll see what’s ’bout to happen next\n Okay?

They debuted it on their Instagram pages back in January 2020.']]), ('I put a skirt on a whip and a crown on the six\n But there’s no need to dress up the numbers', [['Side skirts on cars are used to reduce the amount of high pressure area on the side of the car to go under the car from the sides.\n\n\n\nDrake has also metaphorically crowned “The Six” by continuing to be “numero uno” on the Billboard charts in America while repping for his hometown in Toronto, Canada.\n\nHe’s using wordplay by mentioning clothing accessories such as a “skirt” and a “crown”, and saying that there’s no need to “dress up the numbers” like artists who use merch and album bundle sales.']])]",0.9969,0.9969,0.0827,Energised

December","[('Girl of My Dreams- Rod Wave', [['Lyrics\nSpotify\nMusic Video\n\n“Girl of My Dreams” is the 12th track off of Rod Wave’s fifth studio album, Pray 4 Love. This song is very much an emotional ballad in which Rod describes what he sees in his dream girl. The album was hinted at on Instagram, along with four other songs of the album being previous releases.\n\nThe song, debuting at #98 on the Billboard Hot 100 for the week ending on April 25th, 2020, has blown up largely in part because of the social platform TikTok. The song, currently holding more than 19k videos made on the platform, was met with great support after the success of Rod’s May 2019 track, “Heart on Ice”.\n\nOn May 3rd, 2020, Rod released an accompanying music video to the song. This followed the release of three other music videos, “Fuck The World”, “The Last Sad Song”, and “The Greatest”, all one week apart.\n\nThe record is produced by AceLex. His instrumental conceals a stretched and pitched-up sample of Tula’s 2018 track “Bullet”; it can be heard throughout as a faint background vocal line.']]), ('Pretty Please- Dua Lipa', [['Lyrics\nSpotify\nMusic Video']]), ('No I in Team- Arizona Zervas', [['Lyrics\nSpotify\nMusic Video']]), ('Believe- Meek Mill, Feat. Justin Timberlake', [['Lyrics\nSpotfiy\nMusic Video\n\nMeek Mill and Justin Timberlake team up for the first time on “Believe,” an uplifting banger that Meek designed “for motivational purposes only.” The song was released as a single alongside an accompanying music video starring the two artists.\n\nThe collaboration was first teased by Meek in late December 2019, before being officially announced a few weeks later. The track’s cover art features a short passage of the Bible—suggesting a spiritual tone to the song.\n\nShortly before the release of the single, Justin Timberlake provided insight into the making of the record via Instagram, where he shared a video of the songs creative process and recording.']]), ('Addison Rae- The Kid LAROI', [['Lyrics\nSpotify\nMusic Video\n\nThis song was first previewed by The Kid LAROI in a TikTok video. In the song, he name-drops the famous TikTok personality, Addison Rae. Through her popularity, LAROI’s TikTok video went viral on the platform, amassing 1.4 million views in 19 hours. Addison also created her own TikTok video with the song, which amassed over 8 million likes, furthering the popularity of the song even more.\n\nLAROI announced in a tweet on March 13, 2020, that the song would be dropping “tomorrow.” However, he retracted that statement in another tweet later that day, revealing the release would be delayed a week so it could drop on major streaming platforms at the same time.']]), ('Flightman- Rexx Life Raj, Feat. Kembe X', [['Lyrics\nSpotify\nMusic Video']]), ('FourFiveSeconds- Rihanna, Feat. Kanye West, Paul McCartney', [['Lyrics\nSpotify\nMusic Video\n\n“FourFiveSeconds” features vocals by Rihanna and Kanye West, and instrumentals by Sir Paul McCartney. It has earned praise for its minimalist instrumentals, which include acoustic guitar, cello, and organ, and for blending pop, hip-hop, country, and folk — an unprecedented mash-up for all three performers.\n\nIt was expected to be on her eighth album ANTI, but was not included. The album art for the single reads “Four Five Seconds” in Braille.\n\nIn an interview with V Magazine, Rihanna said she was attracted to the song because of the tension between its sound and its lyrical content.\n\nWhen you read the lyrics it’s a completely different song than what you are hearing. The music is easygoing, but the lyrical content is very loud and in your face.\n\nKanye has compared Rihanna’s vocals on the track to those of Scottish singer Annie Lennox (“the greatest white soul singer alive,” according to VH1).\n\nThe song peaked at number four on the Hot 100, becoming Rihanna’s 26th top ten song, McCartney’s 23rd (not counting his 34 with the Beatles), and West’s 15th. McCartney now holds the record for longest time between top ten hits, with 29 years between “FourFiveSeconds” and “Spies Like Us”, which charted on February 8th, 1986.']]), ('What You Waiting For- R.

Adam is really pessimistic about his empty life now that his relationship has ended.']]), ('The Scotts- The Scotts, Feat. Travis Scott, Kid Cudi', [[""Lyrics\nSpotify\nMusic Video\n“THE SCOTTS” is the eponymous debut single from the hip-hop duo THE SCOTTS, which consists of Travis Scott and Kid Cudi. The track and its lyrical content feature Cudi and Travis dealing with many of the world’s troubles including law enforcement and their opponents. Both the song’s title and the group’s name are derived from Kid Cudi’s real name, Scott Mescudi, and Travis' stage name.\n\nThe track’s instrumental is centered around a crisp twinkling synthesizer and features the heavy bass that is often seen in both artists' discographies.\n\nA snippet of the track was premiered during Travis' live concert event in Fortnite on April 23, 2020, and was released in full on streaming services later at midnight, April 24.\n\nThe song is the first release from Travis Scott in 2020 and his first since his label’s collaborative album, JACKBOYS, released in December 2019.

In one of his earliest songs, June 2008’s “Cleveland is the Reason,” he gives the city credit for growing up to become the man he is:\n\nCleveland is that, (Oh) Cleveland is the (Oh)\nCleveland is the reason I’m cool\nCleveland is that, (Oh) Cleveland is the (Oh)\nCleveland is the reason I’m leanin'\nCleveland is that, (Oh) Cleveland is the (Oh)\nCleveland is the reason I’m cool\nCleveland is that, (Oh) Cleveland is the (Oh)\nCleveland is my, my city (Wow)\n\nHe has made time to give back to the city as well.

Cudi simply states that he has a lot of money.\n\n\n\nThis may also be a crafty allusion to Lil Nas X’s single “Panini,” which was produced by Take a Daytrip and Dot Da Genius—the same producers for “THE SCOTTS.” According to the producers, the “Panini” beat was originally sent to Kid Cudi, but he ultimately passed on it.']]), ('She drink a lot of the bourbon (Yeah)\n Like she from the street (Mmm)', [['Travis makes a play on words with “bourbon,” first using it to describe the actual alcoholic beverage that his significant other enjoys.\n\nSecondly, he plays off of Bourbon Street, a historic street in the French Quarter of New Orleans, Louisiana. The street is an extremely popular tourist destination known for its night life, food, and historic sites.\n\nWhile it is commonly believed that the street is named after the beverage, it is actually named after the Bourbon family, the royal family that was in power during the time of infrastructure development in Louisiana in 1721.']]), ('Tell these phony bitches, “Beat it”\n With that Photoshoppin’ body, Adobe, help me', [[""Adobe Photoshop is a computer software which allows users to create and edit art and images.

Firstly, Travis may be speaking on his direct “outside” surroundings in his hometown of Houston, Texas, where gang activity, violence, and drug dealing were all common occurrences.\n\nTravis' September 2016 track “outside” is titled after the word, addressing similar illegal topic and repeating the phrase:\n\nAll my niggas outside\nAin’t goin' in, yeah\nWe been hangin' outside\n\n“Outside” may also nod to both Cudi and Travis existing on the fringes of the rap industry, away from the mainstream sounds that have existed during their tenure in the game. During his rise to stardom, Cudi was cited for his standout lyrical content, showing a personal, troubled and emotional side in his music during a time in hip-hop where confidence and flash was what sold, while Travis has often been credited with pioneering the psychedelic realm of the current trap-filled landscape of hip-hop.""]]), ('I got tats over my veins (Yeah)\n ’Cause that what I bleed (Mmm)', [[""As of April 2020, Travis has about 39 tattoos on his body, face and arms.

Fucked up a new V, we was dippin'
From the police, I was drillin'

Run up a bag with my bro gods, huh (Bro)
Watch how I show off
Step in the room and she takin' her clothes off
I ain't even say much, huh
Ain't even do much

Know I got a bag, right? Huh
Know I live a fast life
Said she fell in love, met her last night, huh
Said she want this shit for life
Girl, you must be dumb, no, you not the type, huh (What?)
No, I'm not the type
I think I was lost in a past life
Came back, got my cash right
Say you want the sauce, I can get you right
But it's heavyweight, not light (Hold up, hold up)
Bro keep a strap, somethin' like a dyke
He be shootin', he don't like to fight
I could get you wrapped up like a gift
Smoked up like a spliff
Chopper tell 'em back up or get hit
Got my racks up, now I'm lit
I could get you packed up in this bitch
And my blood blue 'cause I'm Crip
Fanny pack full of hundreds (That's a fact)
I just reach on my waist, seen he runnin' (Fuck outta here)
Bitches say a nigga stuntin', huh (Nigga stuntin')
Know they hate how I came up from nothin'
Backed down, get to drummin' (Baow, baow)
I'ma show a nigga how I'm comin'

Rockin' with this TEC, niggas better wear a vest
Last year, I was broke, young nigga in the Crest
Now a show 20 or better, broke niggas keep the rest

I wish a nigga would
I wish a nigga would, I wish a nigga would
I wish a nigga would

California nigga and I'm heavy in these streets
If you don't keep a pole how you ready when it's beef
(If you don't keep a pole)
Lil nigga think he cut, yeah, I bet the nigga freeze
If that nigga want me dead, I can't let that nigga breathe
Want me gone, sent a shot, like the real kind
These niggas actin' like they tough when they real kind
Thumbin' through a 100 racks just to kill time
They got a nigga at the edge, but I feel fine
But it come with this shit, I'm okay with it
If your man's to his last share a plate wit' 'em
One whole wood to the neck, it's an eighth in it
New baby chop, let it sing, it's a Drake nigga
A lot of shit on my mind make me think a lot
Why it's hard for me to smile? 'Cause I seen a lot
You ain't really in the field, you just tweet a lot
If we ain't on the same page, you can kick a rock, bitch!

[Verse 4: Yhung T.O. & Kendrick Lamar]
And I been really tryna keep the peace
But I'm a north Vallejo nigga, and I'm heavy in the streets
I was raised by my granny and the gangsters
So at eight I made the choice I'ma forever be a G, and
I don't really like to talk
I remember we was broke and I don't really like to walk, nigga
Now I ride around in foreign cars
And I put on for my team who was with me from the start, nigga
I don't play games, stitch lip, I don't say names
She want a dog, I'm a Great Dane
I got great aim, Ice Age on my damn chain
My momma told me keep a stash for the damn rain
They ain't wanna see me win 'cause I'm black
So I pulled up in that all black Benz in the back

Before jumping into action, his colleague asks if he’s ready and wants him to promise “not to freeze” or hesitate when attacking, which he replies by promising he won’t. In Daboii’s case, he uses this moment where T’Challa makes sure not to hesitate, even though for a moment he does, since he “thinks he’s cut” and “won’t freeze”. The rapper references this by comparing it to someone who acts tough, but would freeze when they are met with obstacles.']]), ('If we ain’t on the same page, you can kick a rock, bitch!', [['To kick a rock means to get out or go away.

Play if you want, let's do it (Ha)
I'm a young CEO, Suge (Yeah)
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
The first nigga play, I'ma body a nigga (Ha)
I just checked my balance
I'll probably pull up to your hood
And come buy me a nigga (No cap)
You know that your ho told you that nigga crazy
Don't think that she lied to you, nigga (Bitch)
Get caught with your ho when I'm poppin' 'em both
Now they high just like Bobby and Whitney (Haa)
Say I'm the goat, act like I don't know
But fuck it, I'm obviously winnin'
Don't make me go hit the bank and take out a hundred
To show you our pockets are different (Ha)
I'm out with your bitch and I only want knowledge
She got a lil' mileage, I'm chillin' (Uh)
You disrespect me and I'll beat your ass up
All in front of your partners and children (Ahh, ahh)
I'm the type to let a nigga think that I'm broke
Until I pop out with a million (I pop)
Take 20K and put that on your head
And make one of your partners come kill you (Yeah)
Say he fuckin' with me then he gotta grow up
'Cause this nigga gotta be kiddin' (Kiddin')
This shit, it can't fit in my pocket
I got it, like I hit the lottery, nigga (Hot, hot, hot)
Opp, I'll slap the shit out a nigga
No talkin', I don't like to argue with niggas (I don't)
Ain't gon' be no more laughin'
You see me whip out 'cause I'm gon' be done shot me a nigga (No cap)
I don't follow no bitches on IG
But all of your bitches, they follow a nigga (Ha)
And that lil' nigga ain't gon' shoot shit with that gun
He just pull it out in his pictures (Bitch, uh)

Talkin' my shit, I'ma pop that (Pop)
Got like thirty-two thousand in one of my pockets
The other one, that's where the Glock at (Glock)
You little niggas wanna be internet gangster
Man, tell all these little niggas stop that (Ha)
Been done burnt me a nigga in front of the store
Where your mammy and grandmama shop at (Bitch)
Hopped out on a whole other wave from these niggas
Let's see one of you little niggas top that
I will turn a nigga into a convertible
Push me a lil' nigga top back (Vroom)
Her boyfriend be hatin' and callin' her groupie
Just 'cause she like all my music (Ha)
She'll send me a text and then delete the message
He tryna find out, it's confusin'
I don't know what these niggas is thinkin' about
Use the brain in your head 'fore you lose it (Bitch)
I'll pull up after school and I'll teach her some shit
Tell your bro I'm a motherfuckin' tutor
'Member I used to cheat off a pretty bitch test
All the teachers, they thought I was stupid (Uh huh)
Was expectin' the box to pull up on a truck
Man, this nigga pulled up on a scooter (The fuck?)

Always on the court side, uh-huh, huh
B-B-Billionaire niggas wanna eat me out (Hahaha)
Bitch, I'm from the West Coast, they wanna go down South
All these lame ass niggas tryna fuck for clout
Hm, I won't let him hit but he can put it in his mouth

[Chorus]
Lil' waist, fat ass, bitch, tap in
Tap, tap, tap in
Diamonds dancin' on your neck, nigga, tap in
Tap, tap, tap in
Fuck a nigga, get rich, bitch, tap in
Tap, tap, tap in
M-O-B, Icy Gang, nigga, tap in (Mhm, yeah)
Tap, tap, tap in

[Verse 2]
You got a itty-bitty waist (Huh?), pretty in the face (What?)
Never let a broke nigga take you on a date (Nah)
Nah, haters can't relate, bitch, I've never been fake (Girl, bye)
I got a real nigga puttin' icing on my cake (Mwah)
Icy from my lips to my fingers to my toenails
Drippin' in Shanaenae, this ain't goin' on sale
All these hoes busy, baby, I do not do friends well
Lotta niggas pussy, but I promised that I won't tell
Hmm, now, what's my favorite word? (Icy)
Bitch gon' smile, but I know she don't like me
Two hundred for a verse, bitch, I'm way too pricey
Fuck around and bring back hyphy

[Chorus]
Lil' waist, fat ass, bitch, tap in
Tap, tap, tap in
Diamonds dancin' on your neck, nigga, tap in
Tap, tap, tap in
Fuck a nigga, get rich, bitch, tap in
Tap, tap, tap in
M-O-B, Icy Gang, nigga, tap in
